      "This paper proposes a method of improving the extraction efficiency of InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using textured zinc oxide (ZnO) prepared by liquid phase deposition (LPD). The treatment solution for liquid-phase-deposited ZnO (LPD-ZnO) consisted of hydrochloric acid (HCl) saturated with ZnO powder. The deposition temperature was maintained at 30 <sup>°</sup>C using a temperature-controlled water bath system. Atomic force microscope images of the LPD-ZnO indicate that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the LPD-ZnO is dependent on the HCl concentration. As compared with conventional the InGaN/GaN LED, the extraction efficiency of the InGaN/GaN LED with the LPD-ZnO-textured layer increases in conjunction with RMS roughness. The maximum light output intensity enhancement of 48% for the InGaN/GaN LED with an RMS roughness of 16.26 nm occurred under a driving current of 20 mA. The calculated optical intensity of the InGaN/GaN LED with a bumplike LPD-ZnO-textured surface indicates that the optimum RMS roughness of the textured surface layer applied to InGaN/GaN LEDs is approximately 16 nm, which agrees with the experimental results. The InGaN/GaN LED with LPD-ZnO with an RMS roughness of 16.26 nm shows a wide light output divergence angle, which satisfies the requirement of the applications of a backlight source. \n",

Combining nanoimprinting and photolithography techniques, nanocavities array can be fabricated at designated locations on the LEDs. The color-conversion efficiency of selective area nanocavities LED can be enhanced by up to 13%. The significant color-conversion efficiency enhancement is attributed to resonance of InP QDs emission in nanocavities and nonradiative energy transfer from LED active layers to InP QDs, which has been investigated and characterized by finite domain time-domain simulation, electroluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. This hybrid nanostructured device, therefore, exhibits a great potential for the applications of multicolor lighting sources and micro-LED. \n",

      "Forward error correction based multiple description (MD-FEC) transcoding for transmitting embedded bitstream over the packet erasure networks has been extensively studied in the past. In the existing work, a single embedded source bitstream, e.g., the bitstream of a group of pictures (GOP) encoded using three-dimensional set partitioning in hierarchical trees is optimally protected unequal error protection (UEP) in the rate-distortion sense. However, most of the previous work on transmitting embedded video using MD-FEC assumed that one GOP is transmitted only once, and did not consider the chance of retransmission. This may lead to noticeable video quality variations due to varying channel conditions. In this paper, a novel window-based packetization scheme is proposed, which combats bursty packet loss by combining the following three techniques: UEP, retransmission, and GOP-level interleaving. In particular, two retransmission mechanisms, namely segment-wise retransmission and byte-wise retransmission, are proposed based on different types of receiver feedback. Moreover, two levels of rate allocations are introduced: intra-GOP rate allocation minimizes the distortion of individual GOP; while inter-GOP rate allocation intends to reduce video quality fluctuations by adaptively allocating bandwidth according to video signal characteristics and client buffer status. In this way, more consistent video quality can be achieved under various packet loss probabilities, as demonstrated by our experimental results. \n",

      "Filtering out unrealistic images from trained generative adversarial networks (GANs) has attracted considerable attention recently. Two density ratio based subsampling methods-Discriminator Rejection Sampling (DRS) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN)-were recently proposed, and their effectiveness in improving GANs was demonstrated on multiple datasets. However, DRS and MH-GAN are based on discriminator-based density ratio estimation (DRE) methods, so they may not work well if the discriminator in the trained GAN is far from optimal. Moreover, they do not apply to some GANs (e.g., MMD-GAN). In this paper, we propose a novel Softplus (SP) loss for DRE. Based on it, we develop a sample-based DRE method in a feature space learned by a specially designed and pre-trained ResNet-34, termed DRE-F-SP. We derive the rate of convergence of a density ratio model trained under the SP loss. Then, we propose three density ratio based subsampling methods for GANs based on DRE-F-SP. Our subsampling methods do not rely on the optimality of the discriminator and are suitable for all types of GANs. We empirically show our subsampling approach can substantially outperform DRS and MH-GAN on a synthetic dataset, CIFAR-10, MNIST and CelebA, using multiple GANs. \n",

      "We report a novel approach in fabricating high-performance enhancement mode (E-mode) AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The fabrication technique is based on fluoride-based plasma treatment of the gate region in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and post-gate rapid thermal annealing with an annealing temperature lower than 500/spl deg/C. Starting with a conventional depletion-mode HEMT sample, we found that fluoride-based plasma treatment can effectively shift the threshold voltage from -4.0 to 0.9 V. Most importantly, a zero transconductance (g/sub m/) was obtained at V/sub gs/=0 V, demonstrating for the first time true E-mode operation in an AlGaN/GaN HEMT. At V/sub gs/=0 V, the off-state drain leakage current is 28 μA/mm at a drain-source bias of 6 V. The fabricated E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with 1 μm-long gate exhibit a maximum drain current density of 310 mA/mm, a peak g/sub m/ of 148 mS/mm, a current gain cutoff frequency f<sub>T</sub> of 10.1 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency f<sub>max</sub> of 34.3 GHz. \n",

      "In this article, pulsed measurements of thermal resistance in GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) on silicon, with different gate geometries and gate-to-drain extensions, are analyzed and modeled. Simple expressions for the thermal resistance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs, which take into account the gate width and channel length, can be adapted to model the thermal resistance of these GaN-based HEMTs. Narrow width effects and the increase in the heat flow through the gate as the channel length increases were correctly reproduced. In addition, numerical simulations were performed to explain the reduction obtained in thermal resistance as the gate-to-drain extension increases. Our approach can also be applied easily to other well-established models using circuit simulators. \n",

      "This article addresses the problem of remote sensing image pan-sharpening from the perspective of generative adversarial learning. We propose a novel deep neural network-based method named pansharpening GAN (PSGAN). To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts at producing high-quality pan-sharpened images with generative adversarial networks (GANs). The PSGAN consists of two components: a generative network (i.e., generator) and a discriminative network (i.e., discriminator). The generator is designed to accept panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images as inputs and maps them to the desired high-resolution (HR) MS images, and the discriminator implements the adversarial training strategy for generating higher fidelity pan-sharpened images. In this article, we evaluate several architectures and designs, namely, two-stream input, stacking input, batch normalization layer, and attention mechanism to find the optimal solution for pan-sharpening. Extensive experiments on QuickBird, GaoFen-2, and WorldView-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed PSGANs not only are effective in generating high-quality HR MS images and superior to state-of-the-art methods but also generalize well to full-scale images. \n",

      "A virtual try-on network has gradually become a popular topic in recent years. It aims to transfer images of in-shop clothes onto the image of a target person. Owing to the diversity of clothing attributes, developing an image-based virtual try-on network is a complicated task for computers to perform and requires significant effort. Existing methods are unsatisfactory as they cannot preserve the characteristics of the clothes or the target person's identity well, thereby affecting the perception of the generated images; therefore, further research is required. To address this problem, we propose a novel try-on method that combines attribute transformation and local rendering. First, we employ pixel-level semantic segmentation to identify the try-on area and provide implementation conditions for local rendering. Second, we construct a learnable attribute transformation module to complete the try-on task for different attributes. Third, we use a learnable clothing warping module to fit the pose and figure of the target person well and establish a novel loss function, called modified style loss (M-SL), to handle clothes with rich details. Finally, we adopt a local rendering strategy, using which only renders the clothing area to ensure that the details of the non-target area are not lost. Extensive experiments are performed to test our method. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. \n",

      "Tri-Anode GaN Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBDs) have recently shown excellent DC performance with low turn-on voltage and large breakdown thanks to their 3D contact structure around the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel. However, the 3D nature of the Tri-Anode structure is also often believed to hinder the device switching performance. In this work, we demonstrate that, on the contrary, the Tri-Anode architecture significantly enhances the device switching performance with respect to conventional planar SBDs, as shown by a substantial decrease in the recovery charge and an improvement in frequency response. The Tri-Anode SBDs excellent static and dynamic performance is then applied to a real circuit to demonstrate a monolithically integrated high-frequency Full Bridge Rectifier. These results show the potential of Tri-Anode SBDs for high-efficiency and fast-switching power integrated circuits. \n",

In this article, GaN-based negative capacitance field-effect transistors (NCFETs) were fabricated by introducing HfO<sub>2</sub> /P(VDF-TrFE) stack as the gate dielectric layer. With the voltage amplification effect of the ferroelectric, the GaN NCFETs demonstrate the ultralow SS value of 36.3 mV/dec at room temperature, which also advances the MOSFETs in terms of saturation current (633.4 μA/μm) and ON - OFF ratio (&gt; 10<sup>7</sup>). Therefore, this article demonstrates the feasibility of NCFETs for breaking the Boltzmann limit in III-V semiconductors-based transistors and opens up an avenue for switching electronic devices for portable applications. \n",

      "We performed epitaxial growth of GaInNAs laser diodes under various growth rates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. A strong correlation was found between the growth rate and the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. At the optimum growth rate, PL peak intensity and full-width at half-maximum of the PL peak were at a maximum and minimum, respectively. As a result of processing on a GaInNAs narrow-ridge waveguide laser device, a strong correlation was found between the growth rate and the device characteristics. At the optimum growth rate, which was the same optimum growth rate for the PL characteristics, the threshold current and characteristic temperature were also at their optimum values. It is clear that the growth rate is an important parameter for crystal quality and device characteristics. As a result of the optimization of the growth rate and the other growth conditions, a high characteristic temperature of 180 K and a long device lifetime over 1000 h were obtained. \n",

The increase of the breakdown voltage is attributed to the expansion of the depletion region under the 2-D electron gas (2-DEG) channel.

      "This letter reports the excellent radio frequency output characteristics of AlGaN/GaN-on-Si power amplifier (PA) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) operating at the Ka-band, employing a recessed metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure with SiN<sub>x</sub>/HfON dual dielectric layers. The fabricated 0.15-μm AlGaN/GaN-on-Si high electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) exhibited a low OFF-state current and reduced current collapse in comparison with the conventional Schottky gate HEMT; therefore, an enhanced output power of the PA MMIC is achieved. The fabricated two-stage PA MMIC exhibited a continuous-wave output power of &gt;29 dBm with a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 14.5% at the drain voltage of 20 V, at 26.5 GHz. \n",

      "This paper presents a new baseband equivalent (BBE) Volterra-series model suitable for the behavioral modeling and linearization of wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). Starting with passband Volterra series, and following a number of signal transformations, a discrete expression relating the envelopes of the output and input signals to the carrier frequency was derived. The new BBE Volterra series reduces the number of kernels, and hence, avoids resorting to the pruning approaches commonly applied in the literature to the classical low-pass equivalent (LPE) Volterra formulation. The proposed baseband Volterra series has similar modeling and linearization performance to the full classical LPE Volterra series. It also outperforms the pruned LPE Volterra models, which use a dynamic deviation reduction approach, in terms of both linearization performance and complexity. The proposed BBE Volterra series was successfully used to linearize different PAs (200-W LDMOS Doherty and 45-W broadband GaN PA) driven with wideband and intra-band carrier aggregated signals (mixed LTE and WCDMA signals). \n",

      "Given the problem that the drive system of the traditional mine transportation winch outputs a large traction force through the cooperation of an induction motor and reducer to meet the needs of a large traffic volume and heavy-load starting, this paper studies a low-speed and high-torque dual-stator permanent magnet direct drive motor with a separated magnetic circuit. The tinner motor is a torque motor, and the outer motor is a direct drive motor, which is characterized by no magnetic circuit coupling and independent control. The proposed motor has an excellent heavy load starting ability and operation efficiency, and it improves the output torque without increasing the motor volume, which belongs to a special application. According to the working characteristics of the inner and outer motors and the constraints between the overall dimensions, the size equation is derived, and the design principles of the electromagnetic parameters, pole-slot combination and winding structure are described. The torque characteristics and temperature rise characteristics of the motor are simulated using the finite element method and compared with the torque performance and electromagnetic materials cost of the single stator low-speed and high-torque permanent magnet motor with different rotor structures. The results show that the proposed motor has a high torque density and starting torque, and it greatly reduces the motor volume on the basis of a small cost difference. \n",

      "An enhancement-mode high-electron-mobility transistor with a p-GaN gate was fabricated by using a chemistry-ease Cl<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>-based inductively coupled plasma etching technique. This etching technique features a precise etching self-termination at the AlGaN barrier surface, which enables a broad process window with a large tolerance of etching time. With a post-annealing process, the property of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) can be restored to a high level after the etching. The mechanisms of etching self-termination and 2DEG recovery were clarified. The fabricated device exhibits a drain saturation current of 355 mA/mm with a threshold voltage of +1.1 V, an on/off ratio of 10<sup>7</sup>, and a static on-resistance R<sub>ON</sub> of 10 Ω·mm. Furthermore, normally-off operation of the device can be achieved across the wafer. \n",

      "When Fabry-Perot lasers are subject to Rayleigh backscatter, dramatic line-narrowing and frequency hopping up to 500 MHz, evidenced by radio-frequency (RF) tones, are observed. These RF tones will severely degrade the system performance of a subcarrier multiplexed transmission system, such as quadrature phase-shift keying. In this letter, it is demonstrated that audio-frequency external optical-phase modulation can suppress the noise tones and restore the laser linewidth. This scheme may offer an inexpensive alternative to optical isolators to recover the system performance and thus is very important for cost-effective customer access networks. \n",

A constant direct current (dc) current source is realized as a self-bootstrapping device in the presented 0.25-μm in-house gallium nitride (GaN) technology. First, measurements with a low-power [1-V peak-peak voltage (Vii)] differential input signal show the feasibility of switching constant currents with a clock frequency of up to 2 GHz. Furthermore, a 2-b DAC that uses a differential sampling to generate RF-signals is introduced. Measurement results prove the feasibility of synthesizing custom-modulated voltage waveforms with data rates of up to 8 Gbit/s in the sub-6-GHz frequency range. \n",

      "III-nitride nanowires (NWs) were grown on Si(111) without catalyst by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy under N-rich conditions. The influence of doping on the morphology and electrical properties was investigated. The morphology as well as the density of GaN NWs changes with Si amount. For high Si fluxes, the wire density is reduced, in addition, the NWs broaden from bottom to top. By doping with Mg, the NW shape does not significantly change although the wires tend to coalesce. The photoelectric transport in GaN NWs is extremely sensitive to the NW diameter. This effect is used to determine the doping level. The free carrier concentration and mobility were also estimated using Raman measurements. For Si-doped InN NWs, a reduced NW density is observed, in comparison to the undoped counterpart. At high Si doping, the InN NW morphology is improved leading to more uniform diameter NWs. InN NWs have metallic conductance because of a high background bulk concentration and the surface electron accumulation layer. The broadening of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra as a function of Fermi level was used to determine the electron concentration in different InN NW samples. A comparison of Raman scattering and electrical measurements is also presented. \n",

      "This paper introduces a new pattern, called interdependent patterns consisting of genes that are closely interdependent in the information transmission process on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Firstly, information flow starts to broadcast from activated genes to any other genes through the shortest paths, in which information is processed, and retransmitted by the genes adhering to the paths. In the process, some genes are highly interdependent, called interdependent genes, i.e., the failure of one of them will trigger a cascading failure of some other of them. Then, for identifying interdependent patterns, we introduce a gene interdependent network (GIN), in which two genes are connected by a link if they are interdependent, and one interdependent pattern corresponds to a densely connected subnetwork in the GIN. Finally, we extract interdependent patterns in the GIN by the modularity optimization method. The results show that interdependent patterns are less likely to be the modular structures in PPI networks, i.e., the pairs of interdependent genes tend not to interact directly in PPI networks, and the genes without direct interactions are also enriched with biological significance. \n",

      "Playing a vital role in the safe operation of equipment, intelligent fault detection has been extensively applied in mechanical systems. However, the complicated mapping of signal symptoms and multicomponent failure modes under sharp speed variation makes it hard. The classification error is large due to insufficient samples in the fault condition. Aiming at these problems, a novel multitask redundant lifting adversarial network (MRLAN) is proposed. First, inspired by redundant second-generation wavelet transform, a reconstruction network is established to generate high-quality time-frequency representation of vibration signal, thus eliminating speed fluctuations and expanding training samples. The reconstruction network consists of transposed convolution layer, resume update layer, resume predict layer, and merge layer. Then, multitask category discriminator, which forms dual discriminator together with distance discriminator, is constructed to separate the features of multiple components, thereby realizing multiple tasks (multicomponent fault location and single-component health assessment). Finally, the model is alternately optimized through adversarial process between the generation network and the double discriminators. The proposed method is validated by two cases and other methods are also established to show its superiority. The results show satisfactory performance of MRLAN in multicomponent fault diagnosis under sharp speed fluctuation and little training data. \n",

Characteristic rise times for the transient overshoot peak are found to be shorter for transport along the <i>c</i>-axis. Stationary electron velocity is significantly larger for transport oriented in the basal plane than along the <i>c</i> -axis. No significant anisotropy is observed, however, in either the transient or steady-state electron velocity as a function of field orientation within the basal plane itself. The higher peak transient and stationary velocities in the basal plane are directly attributable to the anisotropy of the electronic dispersion, which exhibits lower effective mass along the Gamma-<i>M</i> and Gamma-<i>K</i> directions and greater nonparabolicity along the Gamma-<i>A</i> direction. \n",

      "Direct speech-to-image translation without text is an interesting and useful topic due to the potential applications in human-computer interaction, art creation, computer-aided design. etc. Not to mention that many languages have no writing form. However, as far as we know, it has not been well-studied how to translate the speech signals into images directly and how well they can be translated. In this paper, we attempt to translate the speech signals into the image signals without the transcription stage. Specifically, a speech encoder is designed to represent the input speech signals as an embedding feature, and it is trained with a pretrained image encoder using teacher-student learning to obtain better generalization ability on new classes. Subsequently, a stacked generative adversarial network is used to synthesize high-quality images conditioned on the embedding feature. Experimental results on both synthesized and real data show that our proposed method is effective to translate the raw speech signals into images without the middle text representation. Ablation study gives more insights about our method. \n",

Our approach facilitates tasks for volume analysis that are challenging to achieve using existing rendering techniques such as ray casting or texture-based methods. We show how to guide the user in transfer function editing by quantifying expected change in the output image. Additionally, the generative model transforms transfer functions into a view-invariant latent space specifically designed to synthesize volume-rendered images. We use this space directly for rendering, enabling the user to explore the space of volume-rendered images. As our model is independent of the choice of volume rendering process, we show how to analyze volume-rendered images produced by direct and global illumination lighting, for a variety of volume datasets. \n",

      "At present, countless approaches to fault diagnosis in reciprocating machines have been proposed, all considering that the available machinery dataset is in equal proportions for all conditions. However, when the application is closer to reality, the problem of data imbalance is increasingly evident. In this paper, we propose a method for the creation of diagnoses that consider an extreme imbalance in the available data. Our approach first processes the vibration signals of the machine using a wavelet packet transform-based feature-extraction stage. Then, improved generative models are obtained with a dissimilarity-based model selection to artificially balance the dataset. Finally, a Random Forest classifier is created to address the diagnostic task. This methodology provides a considerable improvement with 99% of data imbalance over other approaches reported in the literature, showing performance similar to that obtained with a balanced set of data. \n",

      "This paper proposes a novel algorithm to estimate the noise level function (NLF) of signal-dependent noise (SDN) from a single image based on the sparse representation of NLFs. Noise level samples are estimated from the high-frequency discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of nonlocal-grouped low-variation image patches. Then, an NLF recovery model based on the sparse representation of NLFs under a trained basis is constructed to recover NLF from the incomplete noise level samples. Confidence levels of the NLF samples are incorporated into the proposed model to promote reliable samples and weaken unreliable ones. We investigate the behavior of the estimation performance with respect to the block size, sampling rate, and confidence weighting. Simulation results on synthetic noisy images show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed method is evaluated on real noisy images captured by three types of commodity imaging devices, and shows consistently excellent SDN estimation performance. The estimated NLFs are incorporated into two well-known denoising schemes, nonlocal means and BM3D, and show significant improvements in denoising SDN-polluted images. \n",

      "In this article, pulsed measurements of thermal resistance in GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) on silicon, with different gate geometries and gate-to-drain extensions, are analyzed and modeled. Simple expressions for the thermal resistance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs, which take into account the gate width and channel length, can be adapted to model the thermal resistance of these GaN-based HEMTs. Narrow width effects and the increase in the heat flow through the gate as the channel length increases were correctly reproduced. In addition, numerical simulations were performed to explain the reduction obtained in thermal resistance as the gate-to-drain extension increases. Our approach can also be applied easily to other well-established models using circuit simulators. \n",

      "The great success achieved by deep neural networks attracts increasing attention from the manufacturing and healthcare communities. However, the limited availability of data and high costs of data collection are the major challenges for the applications in those fields. We propose in this work AISEL, an active image synthesis method for efficient labeling, to improve the performance of the small-data learning tasks. Specifically, a complementary AISEL dataset is generated, with labels actively acquired via a physics-based method to incorporate underlining physical knowledge at hand. An important component of our AISEL method is the bidirectional generative invertible network (GIN), which can extract interpretable features from the training images and generate physically meaningful virtual images. Our AISEL method then efficiently samples virtual images not only further exploits the uncertain regions but also explores the entire image space. We then discuss the interpretability of GIN both theoretically and experimentally, demonstrating clear visual improvements over the benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our AISEL framework on aortic stenosis application, in which our method lowers the labeling cost by 90 percent while achieving a 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy. \n",

      "A novel normally-off AIN/GaN metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistors (MOSHEMT) on 100-mm Si substrates for high-power applications is demonstrated for the first time by means of a selective thermal oxidation of AIN. The formation of a high-quality insulating AION layer resulting from the dry thermal oxidation of AIN at 900 <sup>°</sup>C in oxygen has been identified by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The AIN thermal oxidation appears to be highly selective toward the SiN cap layer allowing the local depletion of the 2-D electron gas (self-aligned to the gate) and thus the achievement of normally-off operation. Threshold voltage (V<sub>T</sub>) of +0.8 V and drain leakage current at V<sub>GS</sub> = 0 V well below 1 μA/mm are obtained reproducibly over the wafer. The comparison of the fabricated MOSHEMTs with the control sample (identical but nonoxidized) reveals a drastic shift of V<sub>T</sub> toward positive values and three to four orders of magnitude drain leakage current reduction. \n",

      "In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method named Semantic Constraint Generative Adversarial Network (SCGAN) for person re-identification (Re-ID) in camera sensor networks. The proposed SCGAN can generate multiple style pedestrian images with high-level semantic information. To this end, we design two types of semantic constraints, i.e., attention constraint and identity constraint. The attention constraint aims to restrict the significant areas in the attention map to be consistent before and after image transformation. The identity constraint focuses on keeping the identity of the generated pedestrian image to be the same as that of the real one. After generating pedestrian images using SCGAN, we combine them with the real pedestrian images to train the person Re-ID model. Since the proposed SCGAN increases the diversity of training samples, the generalization of Re-ID model is enhanced. We evaluate the proposed SCGAN on three large-scale person Re-ID databases, i.e., Market1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID, and experimental results reveal that the proposed SCGAN yields consistent improvements over other methods. \n",

Within Part II, we investigate how self-heating can modify the results of drain current transient measurements on the basis of combined experimental activity and device simulation. \n",

      "The coupling of quantum well (QW) spontaneous emissions to surface plasmons (SPs) has been a promising technique to increase emission rate of LEDs. We carried out numeric investigations to explore the electromagnetic nature of these SP modes. It has been shown that the SP resonance frequency on a flat silver/GaN interface, and hence the corresponding emission enhancement factor can be easily tuned by altering the thickness of silver film and the separation between QW and metal. By using coupled SPPs, partial energy transfer across silver film can be achieved, where strong directional light emission can be re-emitted. We also utilized semiconductor simulation technique to investigate the internal operations of our proposed LED. We found that the internal inefficiency of the device might be attributed to the current crowding effect, poor carrier injection, as well as bad overlap of electron and hole wave functions inside the well. The combination of electromagnetic and semiconductor simulation techniques has been presented as a powerful tool in theoretical analysis of SP-mediated emission LED. \n",

      "Movie recommendation systems provide users with ranked lists of movies based on individual's preferences and constraints. Two types of models are commonly used to generate ranking results: 1) long-term models and 2) session-based models. The long-term-based models represent the interactions between users and movies that are supposed to change slowly across time, while the session-based models encode the information of users' interests and changing dynamics of movies' attributes in short terms. In this paper, we propose the LSIC model, leveraging long and short-term information for content-aware movie recommendation using adversarial training. In the adversarial process, we train a generator as an agent of reinforcement learning which recommends the next movie to a user sequentially. We also train a discriminator which attempts to distinguish the generated list of movies from the real records. The poster information of movies is integrated to further improve the performance of movie recommendation, which is specifically essential when few ratings are available. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has robust superiority over competitors and achieves the state-of-the-art results. \n",

After having degrading the electrical performances of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with an electrical stress, we have shown that it is possible to improve the electrical characteristics of the stressed devices by a neutron irradiation. Moreover, we have also reported that the degradation induced by neutron irradiation is more important for the AlInN/GaN HEMTs with a gate interfacial oxide than for the AlInN/GaN HEMTs without a gate interfacial oxide. \n",

Solar cells on contacts with an Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and a TiN barrier coating showed no improvement in performance compared with the cells on Ti/Mo/Mo triple-layer contact, regardless of the CIGS deposition temperature. The variation of the Mo back-contact designs with no impurity diffusion barrier showed a significant decrease in solar cell performance when thin Mo contacts were used. Furthermore, capacitance to voltage measurements showed a decrease in the carrier concentration in CIGS grown on thin Mo contacts compared with the layers for solar cells on Ti/Mo/Mo triple layer structures. Best cell efficiencies of 17.3% were obtained using a Mo back-contact with a thin Ti adhesion layer, in combination with a low-temperature CIGS deposition process with no additional oxide or nitride impurity diffusion barrier layer on stainless steel foils. \n",

      "In this work, a novel n-In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Ga<sub>1-<italic>x</italic></sub>N/N-gallium nitride (GaN) homotype heterostructure is proposed instead of P-GaN/N-GaN homostructure to produce impact-ionization-avalanche-transit-time (IMPATT) diode. Conventional GaN IMPATT device will lose its working ability due to the immature p-type GaN, so this work predicts that the n-In<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Ga<sub>1-<italic>x</italic></sub> N/N-GaN IMPATT diode can be an alternative to the GaN p-n IMPATT diode; thus, the difficulty of the p-type doping process is avoided. The dc and RF large-signal output characteristics with different compositions are investigated in detail. The simulation results show that the power and efficiency of the novel structure device increase when the In composition increases. When the In composition is greater than 0.4, the performance of the homotype heterojunction IMPATT is better than that of p-n IMPATT. Moreover, homotype heterojunction IMPATT is better in frequency bandwidth, and it can hold greater bias current density than p-n IMPATT. Meanwhile, the performance of homotype heterojunction IMPATT does not depend on the thickness of the InGaN layer, but it decreases as the thickness of the p-type region in p-n IMPATT increases. As it has greater potential in the application, this work brings a reference for the design and manufacture of IMPATT devices based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials, especially GaN materials. \n",
