# About

The IEEE Papers Mapper project was created to streamline research management workflows. By leveraging advanced data pipelines and machine learning models, the project aims to provide efficient solutions for categorizing and visualizing large volumes of research papers.

## Motivation

Academic and industrial researchers often deal with overwhelming volumes of research. This tool simplifies the process of managing, classifying, and gaining insights from these papers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Dash & Plotly**: For building interactive web applications.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for managing data.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For paper classification using encoder-only models.
- **MkDocs**: For generating project documentation.
