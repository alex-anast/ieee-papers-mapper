10.1109/TIM.2022.3232670,Data Augmentation for fMRI-Based Functional Connectivity and its Application to Cross-Site ADHD Classification,IEEE,1557-9662,1,72,LOCKED,Journals,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an emerging neuroimaging modality that is widely used to study brain function and disorders due to its advantages of noninvasiveness, no radiation damage, and high spatial resolution. Existing studies have focused on fMRI-based recognition models to help diagnose brain disorders. However, due to the high cost of fMRI data acquisition and labeling, the amount of fMRI data is usually small, which largely limits the performance of recognition models. In addition, cross-site classification is always a challenge in fMRI studies, because the heterogeneity of data collection at different sites increases the complexity and diversity of the data distribution, making the cross-site classification less robust than site-specific classification. In this article, we propose three data augmentation methods based on functional connectivity networks (FCNs) of fMRI data, aided by a deep feature fusion method, for automatic disease identification. First, the Gaussian noise method, Mixup method, and sliding window method are proposed to effectively augment FCN data, as these can balance the variability of the sample distribution. Second, the convolution neural network and graph attention network (GAT) are separately employed to extract local and global features from FCNs. Finally, the two kinds of features are integrated to classify subjects. The experimental results on the attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-200 dataset indicate that: 1) the data augmentation methods can effectively improve identification performance, in particular, the sliding window method performs best; 2) the cross-site ADHD classification is improved by combining the data augmentation method of sliding window and deep feature fusion method; and 3) the rationality of data augmentation for FCNs is explained by visualizing the hidden fused features with t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) algorithm.",10000261,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000261,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000261/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000261/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,19,10012124,2023,2023,1,15,15,0,1353,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089470879', 'id': 37089470879, 'full_name': 'Shengbing Pei', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088701590', 'id': 37088701590, 'full_name': 'Chaoqun Wang', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Institutes of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085544127', 'id': 37085544127, 'full_name': 'Shuai Cao', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Institutes of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37532072800', 'id': 37532072800, 'full_name': 'Zhao Lv', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Multimodal Cognitive Computation, School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China']}}]","['Functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Interpolation', 'Gaussian noise', 'Feature extraction', 'Training', 'Data models', 'Time series analysis']","['Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) identification', 'data augmentation', 'deep feature fusion method', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)', 't-stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE)']","['Data Augmentation', 'Neural Network', 'Brain Function', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Gaussian Noise', 'Brain Disorders', 'Brain Diseases', 'fMRI Data', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data', 'Fusion Method', 'Fusion Methods', 'Fusion Technology', 'Feature Fusion', 'Elimination Method', 'Gaussian Method', 'Elimination Methods', 'Kinds Of Features', 'Kinds Of Characteristics', 'Functional Network Connectivity', 'Data Augmentation Methods', 'Data Augmentation Method', 'Sliding Window Method', 'Sliding Window Methods', 'Sliding-window Method', 'Graph Attention Network', 'Time Series', 'Time-series', 'Training Set', 'Training Data', 'Classification Accuracy', 'Feature Maps', 'Ni Sites', 'Functional Connectivity Matrices', 'Functional Connectivity Matrix', 'Peking University', 'Long Short-term Memory', 'Long Short Term Memory', 'LSTM', 'Graph Neural Networks', 'Metastable State', 'Convolutional Neural Network Features', 'Entire Time Series', 'Entire Time-series', 'Graph Metrics', 'Graph Distance', 'Dynamic Functional Connectivity']",
10.1109/TITS.2022.3169182,Sustainable and Round-Optimized Group Authenticated Key Exchange in Vehicle Communication,IEEE,1558-0016,2,24,LOCKED,Journals,"Vehicle authentication is an essential component validating the vehicle’s identity and ensuring the integrity of transformed data for intelligent transport vehicles (ITS) in the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Easy to deploy and operate privacy-enhancing vehicle authentication mechanisms are the mainstay for the widespread ITS in the VANET. Very recently, VANET security architectures are constituting by IEEE 1609.2 group, NoW project, the SeVeCom project. However, these approaches heavily depend on the consuming public key infrastructure (PKI) and certification authorities (CA). In this work, walking along the research line, we attempt to design authentication protocols with two diverse factors for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks, respectively, without depending on the stumbling block PKI/CA. In addition, a smooth projective hash function (SPHF) (a.k.a., a special case of the designated-verifier zero-knowledge proof system) guarantees any recipient can confirm the authenticity and integrity of the received messages without knowing the authentication factors. Thus, to optimize the communication round, SPHF is used to design a (group) two-factor authenticated key exchange (AKE) with low-interactive communication rounds. The proof-of-concept implementation indicates that the computation and communication overheads introduced by our solution are acceptable in real-world deployments.

To support this age-critical grant-free massive access, we propose a graph-based spatially coupled irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (G-SC-IRSA) random access protocol, which utilizes the pseudo-random access pattern (PRAP), coupled frames, and sliding window decoder (SWD) to improve the packet loss rate (PLR) and AoI performance. Specifically, we derive the approximate expressions to the normalized Average AoI (AAoI) as a function of the PRAP and system load. Then, we establish the problem of minimizing the AAoI under the G-SC-IRSA protocol. Furthermore, we utilize the density evolution (DE) with a bipartite graph to evaluate the system load threshold of G-SC-IRSA in asymptotic regime, achieve an optimal degree distribution via the differential evolution algorithm, and finally obtain the optimal PRAP with progressive edge-growth algorithm. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical derivations and show that the G-SC-IRSA can achieve the minimum AAoI with the optimal PRAP and outperforms the existing benchmark schemes in terms of PLR and AAoI.",10000265,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000265,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000265/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000265/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6488907,10119650,2023,"15 May15, 2023",9007,9021,3,0,407,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089278037', 'id': 37089278037, 'full_name': 'Yuhao Huang', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37864144200', 'id': 37864144200, 'full_name': 'Jian Jiao', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086531912', 'id': 37086531912, 'full_name': 'Ye Wang', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086147052', 'id': 37086147052, 'full_name': 'Shaohua Wu', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37309741500', 'id': 37309741500, 'full_name': 'Rongxing Lu', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Faculty of Computer Science, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada']}}, {'affiliation': 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37289942300', 'id': 37289942300, 'full_name': 'Qinyu Zhang', 'author_order': 6, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China', 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China']}}]","['Protocols', 'Throughput', 'Decoding', 'Receivers', 'Internet of Things', 'Behavioral sciences', 'Analytical models']","['Age of Information (AoI)', 'grant-free', 'massive access', 'pseudo-random access pattern (PRAP)', 'sliding window decoder (SWD)']","['Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA', 'Grant-free Massive Access', 'Age Of Information', 'Digital Age', 'Degree Distribution', 'Random Access', 'Optimal Distribution', 'System Load', 'User Equipment', 'Evolution Of Density', 'Differential Evolution Algorithm', 'Packet Loss Rate', 'Decoding', 'Decryption', 'Internet Of Things', 'Internet-of-Things', 'Window Length', 'Window Lengths', 'Types Of Nodes', 'Performance Of Protocol', 'Operating Protocols', 'Optimal Matrix', 'Optimal Matrices', 'Types Of Edges', 'Frame Length', 'Frame Lengths', 'Variable Nodes', 'Throughput Performance', 'Low-density Parity-check Codes', 'LDPC Codes', 'Low Density Parity Check Codes', 'LDPC', 'Successive Interference Cancellation', 'Parity-check Matrix', 'Parity Check Matrix', 'Parity-check Matrices', 'Check Matrix', 'Successful Decoding', 'Error Floor', 'Low-density Parity-check', 'Low Density Parity Check', 'Internal Edges', 'Incoming Messages', 'Asymptotic Performance']",10

However, most previous studies on serious games used behavioral questionnaires to evaluate their effectiveness. The cognitive assessment of individuals with autism after behavioral intervention or drug treatment has become important because it provides promising biomarkers to assess improvement after cognitive intervention. In this study, we developed a game-based social interaction platform incorporating an eye-tracking system for children and preadolescents with autism. Three modules (focusing on gaze following, facial emotion recognition, and social interaction skills) are included in the platform; participants with autism learn these according to their cognitive abilities. The eye-tracking results showed decreased fixation durations when autistic children looked at positive emotional expressions and focused on multiple targets. Prolonged saccade durations and shorter fixation times for social-related facial emotion expressions were also found in preadolescents and teenagers with autism. Our findings suggest that these atypical gaze patterns are reliable biomarkers for evaluating the social and cognitive functions of autistic individuals while playing serious games. The proposed platform’s game-based modules and the findings regarding aberrant gaze patterns in autistic individuals demonstrate the possibility of evaluating cognitive functions and intervention effectiveness by using eye-tracking signals in a serious game or real-life environment.",10000269,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000269,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000269/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000269/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,7333,10031624,2023,2023,749,758,9,0,3576,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089324025', 'id': 37089324025, 'full_name': 'Yi-Ling Chien', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089706515', 'id': 37089706515, 'full_name': 'Chia-Hsin Lee', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089707011', 'id': 37089707011, 'full_name': 'Yen-Nan Chiu', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089706455', 'id': 37089706455, 'full_name': 'Wen-Che Tsai', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089706949', 'id': 37089706949, 'full_name': 'Yuan-Che Min', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089705837', 'id': 37089705837, 'full_name': 'Yang-Min Lin', 'author_order': 6, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089706218', 'id': 37089706218, 'full_name': 'Jui-Shen Wong', 'author_order': 7, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088920376', 'id': 37088920376, 'full_name': 'Yi-Li Tseng', 'author_order': 8, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan']}}]","['Games', 'Emotion recognition', 'Gaze tracking', 'Autism', 'Pediatrics', 'Face recognition', 'Biomarkers']","['Social interaction game', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'eye tracking', 'serious games']","['Social Media', 'Social Platforms', 'Social Interaction', 'Cognitive Assessment', 'Knowledge Assessment', 'Adolescents', 'Cognitive Function', 'Cognitive Performance', 'Cognitive Skills', 'Cognitive Abilities', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Skills', 'Social Abilities', 'Interpersonal Skills', 'Autism Spectrum', 'Autistic Children', 'Facial Expressions', 'Emotional Expressions', 'Face Recognition', 'Positive Expression', 'Emotion Recognition', 'Cognitive Interventions', 'Cognitive Treatment', 'Knowledge Of Treatment', 'Emotional Faces', 'Behavior Questionnaire', 'Behaviour Questionnaire', 'Emotional Facial Expressions', 'Fixation Time', 'Fixation Duration', 'Typically Developing Children', 'Typically-developing Children', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder Children', 'Typically Developing Participants', 'Typically-developing Participants', 'Typically Developing', 'Neurotypical', 'Typically-developing', 'Scenario Description', 'Video Games', 'Computer Games', 'Total Fixation Duration', 'Joint Attention', 'Shared Attention', 'Gaze Location', 'Virtual Reality Platform']",

Please follow the instructions via https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ to obtain full-text articles and stipulations in the API documentation.,Journals,"Cloud computing technology has undergone tremendous growth in recent years, and there are now many cloud service providers (CSPs). This makes CSP selection a challenging process for cloud users. Further complications arise when users modify the priorities of their requirements. Moreover, concerns such as complex computation, inconsistencies, and rank reversal have been raised in current approaches, resulting in less reliable results. This study presents a new hybrid multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for ranking cloud services based on Markov chains combined with the best-only method (BOM). The Markov chain is used to record and track the changes in the priorities of user requirements and determine their final values. Then, the BOM method is utilized to determine the final weights of the QoS criteria based on pairwise comparisons made by the cloud user or decision maker and the final priorities of the user’s requirements. Finally, the cloud services are ranked, and the best CSP is selected. The proposed framework was validated using a case study and a real dataset. Performance, consistency, rank conformance, and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the proposed framework. The obtained results prove that the proposed framework is computationally efficient and fully consistent, considers the user requirements and its transition pattern, and is robust to rank reversal.",10000396,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000396,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000396/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000396/,IEEE Access,6287639,10005208,2023,2023,50,66,2,0,5021,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering at Helwan, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085411011', 'id': 37085411011, 'full_name': 'Ahmed M.

10.1109/TCDS.2022.3232569,Channel-Correlation-Based Selective Knowledge Distillation,IEEE,2379-8939,6,15,LOCKED,Journals,"As a simple yet effective model compression method, knowledge distillation (or KD) is used to learn a small lightweight student network by transferring valuable knowledge from a pretrained cumbersome teacher network. However, existing KD methods usually consider the feature knowledge either in different layers or individual samples, failing to explore more detailed information in different channels from the perspective of sample relationships. Meanwhile, the negative influences contained in the teacher knowledge are also not well investigated, especially, when using the response-based knowledge. To address the above-mentioned issues, we devise a novel KD approach entitled channel correlation-based selective KD (or CCSKD). Specifically, to distill rich knowledge from feature representations, we not only consider the feature knowledge from different channels for individual samples but also take into account the relational knowledge based on per-channel features for different samples. Furthermore, to further distill positive response-based knowledge, a selective strategy is developed, i.e., selective KD, to progressively correct the negative influences from the teacher knowledge during the distillation process.

There is a need for optimal investment decisions to reduce the electricity consumption costs of the households further. In this letter, we first develop analytical expression of storage investment decision and then of solar investment decision for a household which is under net metering billing mechanism with time of use pricing condition. Using real data of a residential household in Austin, TX, USA, we study how the investment decisions would provide benefit for a period of one year. Results show significant profit when using storage devices and solar panels optimally for the system. It is important to note that though our approach can help significantly to take investment decisions, the solution will still be sub-optimal for somebody who needs optimal investment jointly on both storage and solar systems.",10000399,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000399,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000399/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000399/,IEEE Control Systems Letters,7782633,9828546,2023,2023,1189,1194,4,0,522,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Hyderabad, India', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089680498', 'id': 37089680498, 'full_name': 'Victor Sam Moses Babu K.', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Hyderabad, India']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Hyderabad, India', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085387526', 'id': 37085387526, 'full_name': 'Pratyush Chakraborty', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Hyderabad, India']}}, {'affiliation': 'Instituto de las Tecnologías Avanzadas de la Producción, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267959800', 'id': 37267959800, 'full_name': 'Enrique Baeyens', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Instituto de las Tecnologías Avanzadas de la Producción, Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37326396500', 'id': 37326396500, 'full_name': 'Pramod P.

10.1109/JIOT.2022.3232582,MPDM: A Multi-Paradigm Deployment Model for Large-Scale Edge-Cloud Intelligence,IEEE,2372-2541,8,10,LOCKED,Journals,"The development of cloud and edge computing has enabled the easy access of artificial intelligence (AI) services for massive heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices. Particularly, computation-intensive AI services can be orchestrated and deployed in the cloud or edge according to varying performance and cost requirements. Nonetheless, the improved accessibility of deep learning (DL) model variants and the evolving of computational intelligence paradigms pose great challenges for orchestrating large-scale DL inference services in the cloud-edge continuum. Focusing on cloud or edge-based deployment, existing work on multi-variant service orchestration often has a limited solution space of deployment plans. To address this limitation, we first propose a novel multi-paradigm deployment model (MPDM) for service orchestration, which not only considers the model variants but also allows the co-existence of multiple paradigms for large-scale inference service deployment. The service deployment in the MPDM model is then formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem of seeking a better tradeoff among the system accuracy, service scale, and deployment cost. To solve the multiobjective optimization, we further propose a weighted metric-based constructive heuristic algorithm (WCH), which can efficiently obtain an approximately optimal Pareto frontier. Extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of WCH, and revealed the impacts of both multi-paradigm deployment and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI) paradigm on large-scale DL serving systems.",10000402,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000402,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000402/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000402/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6488907,10119650,2023,"15 May15, 2023",8773,8785,1,0,714,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088888408', 'id': 37088888408, 'full_name': 'Luhui Wang', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085700349', 'id': 37085700349, 'full_name': 'Xuebin Ren', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086413224', 'id': 37086413224, 'full_name': 'Cong Zhao', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088552260', 'id': 37088552260, 'full_name': 'Fangyuan Zhao', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37675912600', 'id': 37675912600, 'full_name': 'Shusen Yang', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}]","['Cloud computing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Computational modeling', 'Costs', 'Optimization', 'Analytical models']","['Edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI)', 'multiobjective optimization', 'service deployment', 'service orchestration']","['Edge Computing', 'Edge Cloud', 'Deployment Model', 'Optimization Problem', 'Deep Learning Models', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Storage', 'Cloud-based', 'Cloud Server', 'Extensive Experiments', 'Multi-objective Optimization', 'Multi-objective Problem', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Intelligence', 'Pareto Front', 'Pareto Frontier', 'Multi-objective Optimization Problem', 'Deployment Cost', 'Service Deployment', 'Objective Function', 'Time Cost', 'Evolutionary Algorithms', 'Development Of Algorithms', 'Average Accuracy', 'Weight Vector', 'Objective Value', 'Demand For Resources', 'Set Of Variants', 'Edge Nodes', 'Large-scale Problems', 'Large Scale Problems', 'State-of-the-art Models', 'State Of The Art Models', 'Cloud Infrastructure', 'Lightweight Model', 'Hypervolume', 'Four-dimensional Space', 'Placement Problem', 'EU Energy', 'European Union Energy', 'Internal Energy Market', 'Set Of Plans', 'Inference Accuracy', 'Single-objective Optimization Problem', 'Single Objective Optimization Problem']",10
10.1109/JSAC.2022.3229419,Imitation Learning-Based Implicit Semantic-Aware Communication Networks: Multi-Layer Representation and Collaborative Reasoning,IEEE,1558-0008,9,41,LOCKED,Journals,"Semantic communication has recently attracted significant interest from both industry and academia due to its potential to transform the existing data-focused communication architecture towards a more generally intelligent and goal-oriented semantic-aware networking system. Despite its promising potential, semantic communications and semantic-aware networking are still in their infancy. Most existing works focus on transporting and delivering the explicit semantic information, e.g., labels or features of objects, that can be directly identified from the source signal. The original definition of semantics as well as recent results in cognitive neuroscience suggest that it is the implicit semantic information, in particular the hidden relations connecting different concepts and feature items that play the fundamental role in recognizing, communicating, and delivering the real semantic meanings of messages. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel reasoning-based implicit semantic-aware communication network architecture that allows destination users to directly learn a reasoning mechanism that can automatically generate complex implicit semantic information based on a limited clue information sent by the source users. Our proposed architecture can be implemented in a multi-tier cloud/edge computing networks in which multiple tiers of cloud data center (CDC) and edge servers can collaborate and support efficient semantic encoding, decoding, and implicit semantic interpretation for multiple end-users. We introduce a new multi-layer representation of semantic information taking into consideration both the hierarchical structure of implicit semantics as well as the personalized inference preference of individual users. We model the semantic reasoning process as a reinforcement learning process and then propose an imitation-based semantic reasoning mechanism learning (iRML) solution to learning a reasoning policy that imitates the inference behavior of the source user. A federated graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative reasoning solution is proposed to allow multiple edge servers to jointly construct a shared semantic interpretation model based on decentralized semantic message samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted based on real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture. Numerical results confirm that iRML offers up to 25.8 dB improvement on the semantic symbol error rate, compared to the semantic-irrelevant communication solutions.",10000405,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000405,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000405/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000405/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,49,10044995,2023,March 2023,639,658,21,0,2491,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37673973800', 'id': 37673973800, 'full_name': 'Yong Xiao', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China', 'Pazhou Laboratory (Huangpu), Guangzhou, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088976853', 'id': 37088976853, 'full_name': 'Zijian Sun', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267099300', 'id': 37267099300, 'full_name': 'Guangming Shi', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China', 'Pazhou Laboratory (Huangpu), Guangzhou, China', 'School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Jurong West, Singapore', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37296968900', 'id': 37296968900, 'full_name': 'Dusit Niyato', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Jurong West, Singapore']}}]","['Semantics', 'Cognition', 'Servers', 'Collaboration', 'Computer architecture', 'Symbols', 'Entropy']","['Semantic communication', 'implicit semantic-aware communication', 'multi-layer representation', 'multi-tier computing', 'collaborative reasoning', 'federated edge intelligence']","['Multi-layer Representation', 'Collaborative Reasoning', 'Semantic Information', 'User Behavior', 'User Behaviour', 'Object Features', 'Objective Characteristics', 'Digital Networks', 'Computer Network', 'Real-world Datasets', 'Real-world Data Sets', 'Signal Source', 'Semantic Processing', 'Graph Convolutional Network', 'Graph Convolutional Neural Network', 'Reasoning Process', 'Multiple Edges', 'Multi-edge', 'Parallel Edges', 'Semantic Model', 'Edge Server', 'Learning Solutions', 'Hidden Relationships', 'Multiple Servers', 'Semantic Interpretation', 'Semantic Errors', 'Communication Architecture', 'Maximum Entropy Principle', 'Maximum-entropy Principle', 'Semantic Distance', 'Collaborative Training', 'Semantic Representations', 'Meaning Of The Message', 'Semantic Space', 'Abstraction Layer', 'Inference Mechanism', 'Maximum Entropy', 'Local Training']",3
10.1109/COMST.2022.3232576,A Critical Survey of EEG-Based BCI Systems for Applications in Industrial Internet of Things,IEEE,2373-745X,10,25,LOCKED,Journals,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and its applications have seen a paradigm shift since the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, these methods are mostly data-centric and lack flexibility. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is envisioned as an efficient solution that may overcome the shortcomings of data-centric techniques by introducing human intuition in the process loop. In this work, we present an exhaustive study on the feasibility of adopting BCI techniques for industrial applications, particularly Electroencephalography (EEG). We present a comprehensive literature survey on the basics of EEG (including signal processing techniques) and its involved paradigms, together with its application scope. We identify the potential use cases of EEG-based BCI systems in industries in the current traction while accounting for their pros and cons. Additionally, we also highlight the existing challenges and propose possible off-the-shelf solutions for overcoming them. We present a two-pronged study (hardware and software specifications) on its deployment by performing lab-scale experiments with a single-channel EEG headset. We compare the metrics of our experiments to 64, 32, and 25 channel data from other studies (collected from the Internet). On average, we observe CPU usage of up to 35%, memory usage of 1.75 Gb, and data transfer rates of 25 Mbps. In contrast to the conventional setups, we demonstrate how a minimalistic setup using a single-channel EEG headset may facilitate complex applications like job inspection in manufacturing processes,
