10.1109/JIOT.2022.3232629,Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in C-RAN Supporting Wireless Charging,IEEE,10,2372-2541,1,10,LOCKED,Journals,"In this article, we consider a cloud-radio access network (C-RAN) with multiple enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which support for wireless charging, computation offloading and information transmission. The employment of enhanced RRHs requires a redesign for efficient resource allocation. Our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of energy transfer time and computation time by jointly optimizing energy transmission time, energy beamforming vectors, offloading factors, information transmission time, and combining vectors, while satisfying the communication performance requirements of terminal nodes. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which can be solved by alternating optimization (AO) utilizing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and nonlinear transformation. To reduce the online computation delay of AO algorithm, we propose an optimization method based on the deep learning framework, which can determine an optimal solution with a trained neural network in real-time application. To improve the performance of the learning algorithm, we use two methods to set labels for training deep neural network to obtain the optimal offloading decision: 1) preoptimization and 2) self-evolution. Simulation results show that with the trained neural network, the algorithms based on deep learning can achieve a similar performance to the AO algorithm with less computation time.",10000266,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000266,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000266/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000266/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6488907,10119650,2023,"15 May15, 2023",8853,8864,2,0,392,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088360691', 'id': 37088360691, 'full_name': 'Ruijing Li', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37288310700', 'id': 37288310700, 'full_name': 'Lan Tang', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38003883200', 'id': 38003883200, 'full_name': 'Yechao Bai', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'Future Research Laboratory, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086396673', 'id': 37086396673, 'full_name': 'Mengting Lou', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Future Research Laboratory, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38007367400', 'id': 38007367400, 'full_name': 'Xinggan Zhang', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China']}}]","['Wireless communication', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Task analysis', 'Resource management', 'Sensors', 'Information processing', 'Array signal processing']","['Alternating optimization (AO)', 'computation offloading', 'deep neural network', 'resource allocation', 'semidefinite relaxation (SDR)']","['Resource Allocation', 'Computational Resources', 'Wireless Charging', 'Charging Pad', 'Computation Offloading', 'Cloud Radio Access Network', 'Cloud-RAN', 'Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Computation Time', 'Calculation Time', 'Optimization Method', 'Optimization Methods', 'Deep Neural Network', 'Energy Transfer', 'Information Transmission', 'Nonlinear Programming', 'Nonlinear Optimization', 'Energy Transmission', 'High-voltage Transmission', 'Electrical Transmission', 'Transmission Time', 'Sum Of Time', 'Delay Estimation', 'Computation Delay', 'Mixed-integer Nonlinear Programming', 'Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming', 'Alternating Optimization', 'Surrogate Optimization', 'Beamforming Vector', 'Task Offloading', 'Internet Of Things Networks', 'Internet-of-Things Networks', 'Mobile Edge Computing', 'Multi-access Edge Computing', 'Mobile-edge Computing', 'Average Total Time', 'Number Of Terminals', 'Computation Tasks', 'Local Computing', 'Local Calculation', 'Linear Problem', 'Linear Programming Problem', 'Energy Harvesting', 'Total Computation', 'Total Calculation']"

For sub-6 GHz systems, we propose an energy-efficient iterative semi-blind channel estimation scheme for multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low-resolution ADCs. The proposed semi-blind estimator improves the channel state information (CSI) accuracy with the addition of a few data symbols in the CSI acquisition process and concurrently enhances the spectral efficiency (SE) under the minimum pilot length constraint, unlike pilot training based schemes. We also derive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the uplink achievable rate of quantized massive MIMO sub-6 GHz systems. The energy efficiency (EE) and SE of the designed estimator for maximal ratio combining and zero-forcing receivers are also investigated. Furthermore, for the mmWave frequency band of 5G NR, we formulate a sparse Bayesian learning based frequency selective mmWave channel estimation scheme for MIMO systems equipped with hybrid architecture and low-resolution ADCs.

Starting from the traction substation, the traction current flows through the catenary, the train, and finally returns to the traction substation via the steel rail. Due to the absence of the on-line detection technology for rail current, it has been a long time that the magnitude of the current flowing on the rail is unclear. Therefore, how to effectively detect rail current has become an industrial and academic focus recently. This article uses a new type of tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor, focusing on the rail power frequency current online detection technology based on the TMR gradient method. First, this article analyzes the current and the magnetic field distribution characteristics near the rail, then considers the actual installation situation on the spot, and selects the appropriate sensor installation location.

Please follow the instructions via https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ to obtain full-text articles and stipulations in the API documentation.,Journals,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clustering is promising for performing large-scale missions because of high mobility and easy deployment. However, the connectivity problems caused by the high mobility of UAVs and the interferences are mostly ignored in existing UAV mission executions. Rapid restoration of UAV network connectivity is essential for preventing communication disruption and improving the overall network performance. Thus, a graph coalition formation game that integrates the UAV time-varying topology graph with the coalition formation game is proposed to rapidly restore the connectivity of the UAV network in need. The method improves the utility of UAV clustering and ensures the network connectivity. Then, a graph coalition formation game algorithm based on the shortest path tree (SPT-GCF) rapidly forms an approximately optimal coalition structure. The simulation results show that the proposed approach increases the average utility of UAV clustering by 6.5% and 14.5% respectively when compared with the existing non-overlapping coalition formation game (NOCFG) and the coalition formation game without considering the cluster connectivity.",10000401,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000401,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000401/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000401/,IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society,8782661,10008219,2023,2023,79,90,7,0,4076,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089680265', 'id': 37089680265, 'full_name': 'Yeting Huang', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071904500', 'id': 37071904500, 'full_name': 'Nan Qi', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', 'National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089366525', 'id': 37089366525, 'full_name': 'Zanqi Huang', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Space Information, Space Engineering University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085825229', 'id': 37085825229, 'full_name': 'Luliang Jia', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Space Information, Space Engineering University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290356800', 'id': 37290356800, 'full_name': 'Qihui Wu', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37068721100', 'id': 37068721100, 'full_name': 'Rugui Yao', 'author_order': 6, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Communication and Information Engineering, Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086036387', 'id': 37086036387, 'full_name': 'Wenjing Wang', 'author_order': 7, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Communication and Information Engineering, Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi’an, China']}}]","['Games', 'Autonomous aerial vehicles', 'Network topology', 'Interference', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Vehicle dynamics', 'Task analysis']","['UAV cluster', 'connectivity', 'overlapping coalition formation game', 'graph coalition formation game']","['Unmanned Aerial Vehicles', 'Coalition Formation', 'Cooperative Game Theory', 'Coalition Game', 'Coalition Formation Game', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Cluster', 'Shortest Path', 'Graph Topology', 'Connectivity Problems', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Networks', 'Energy Consumption', 'Energy Expenditure', 'Dynamic Network', 'Strong Connection', 'Internet Of Things', 'Network Topology', 'Undirected', 'Undirected Graph', 'Task Execution', 'Time Slot', 'Weak Connections', 'Connectivity Graph', 'Formation Control', 'Nash Equilibrium', 'Transmission Delay', 'Local Optimal Solution', 'Polynomial-time Algorithm', 'Time Complexity Of Algorithm', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Communication', 'Communication Range', 'Connection Failure', 'Cluster Connectivity', 'Communication Connection', 'Communication Delay', 'Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles', 'Communication Demands']"

Particularly, computation-intensive AI services can be orchestrated and deployed in the cloud or edge according to varying performance and cost requirements. Nonetheless, the improved accessibility of deep learning (DL) model variants and the evolving of computational intelligence paradigms pose great challenges for orchestrating large-scale DL inference services in the cloud-edge continuum. Focusing on cloud or edge-based deployment, existing work on multi-variant service orchestration often has a limited solution space of deployment plans. To address this limitation, we first propose a novel multi-paradigm deployment model (MPDM) for service orchestration, which not only considers the model variants but also allows the co-existence of multiple paradigms for large-scale inference service deployment. The service deployment in the MPDM model is then formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem of seeking a better tradeoff among the system accuracy, service scale, and deployment cost. To solve the multiobjective optimization, we further propose a weighted metric-based constructive heuristic algorithm (WCH), which can efficiently obtain an approximately optimal Pareto frontier. Extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of WCH, and revealed the impacts of both multi-paradigm deployment and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI) paradigm on large-scale DL serving systems.",10000402,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000402,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000402/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000402/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6488907,10119650,2023,"15 May15, 2023",8773,8785,1,0,714,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088888408', 'id': 37088888408, 'full_name': 'Luhui Wang', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085700349', 'id': 37085700349, 'full_name': 'Xuebin Ren', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086413224', 'id': 37086413224, 'full_name': 'Cong Zhao', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088552260', 'id': 37088552260, 'full_name': 'Fangyuan Zhao', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37675912600', 'id': 37675912600, 'full_name': 'Shusen Yang', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analytics and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, China']}}]","['Cloud computing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Computational modeling', 'Costs', 'Optimization', 'Analytical models']","['Edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI)', 'multiobjective optimization', 'service deployment', 'service orchestration']","['Edge Computing', 'Edge Cloud', 'Deployment Model', 'Optimization Problem', 'Deep Learning Models', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Storage', 'Cloud-based', 'Cloud Server', 'Extensive Experiments', 'Multi-objective Optimization', 'Multi-objective Problem', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Machine Intelligence', 'Pareto Front', 'Pareto Frontier', 'Multi-objective Optimization Problem', 'Deployment Cost', 'Service Deployment', 'Objective Function', 'Time Cost', 'Evolutionary Algorithms', 'Development Of Algorithms', 'Average Accuracy', 'Weight Vector', 'Objective Value', 'Demand For Resources', 'Set Of Variants', 'Edge Nodes', 'Large-scale Problems', 'Large Scale Problems', 'State-of-the-art Models', 'State Of The Art Models', 'Cloud Infrastructure', 'Lightweight Model', 'Hypervolume', 'Four-dimensional Space', 'Placement Problem', 'EU Energy', 'European Union Energy', 'Internal Energy Market', 'Set Of Plans', 'Inference Accuracy', 'Single-objective Optimization Problem', 'Single Objective Optimization Problem']"

The evaluation results reveal that, compared to a probability-based scheme, NA-DTOA reduces the average task completion time by almost 47% while ensuring a substantially low-average energy outage probability of 0.03.",10000410,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10000410,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000410/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10000410/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6488907,10119650,2023,"15 May15, 2023",8744,8753,4,0,496,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Network Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085416251', 'id': 37085416251, 'full_name': 'Jaewook Lee', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Network Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275585000', 'id': 37275585000, 'full_name': 'Haneul Ko', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea']}}]","['Task analysis', 'Internet of Things', 'Cloud computing', 'Energy harvesting', 'Optimization', 'Mobile handsets', 'Heuristic algorithms']","['Distributed task offloading', 'edge cloud', 'edge computing', 'energy harvesting', 'stochastic game']","['Internet Of Things', 'Internet-of-Things', 'Energy Harvesting', 'Task Offloading', 'Offloading Algorithm', 'Mobile Devices', 'Portable Devices', 'Stochastic Model', 'Average Probability', 'Overall Probability', 'Best Response', 'Internet Of Things Devices', 'Internet-of-Things Devices', 'IoT Devices', 'Edge Computing', 'Edge Cloud', 'Outage Probability', 'Average Completion', 'Task Completion Time', 'Average Completion Time', 'Optimization Problem', 'Energy Levels', 'Cost Function', 'State Space', 'State-space', 'Computational Resources', 'Transition Probabilities', 'Input Data Size', 'Optimal Policy', 'Base Station', 'Nash Equilibrium', 'Offloading Decision', 'Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing', 'OFDM', 'Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing', 'Inequality Constraints', 'Functional Constraints', 'Energy Usage', 'External Conditions', 'External States', 'Markov Decision Process']"

Please follow the instructions via https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ to obtain full-text articles and stipulations in the API documentation.,Journals,"Pervasive new era applications are expected to involve massive amount of data to implement intelligent distributed frameworks based on machine learning, supported by sixth generation (6G) networks technology to offer fast and reliable communications. Federated Learning (FL) is rapidly emerging as promising privacy-preserving solution to train machine learning models in a distributed fashion. However, users are often not too inclined to take part in the learning process without receiving compensation. Hence, to overcome this drawback, the functional integration of a proper devices incentive mechanism with an efficient approach for the devices selection in a same FL framework becomes essential. In this regard, this paper proposes a FL framework involving a one-side matching theory-based incentive mechanism to select and encourage users to take part of the process with the aim at minimizing the FL process convergence time and maximizing the users profit. Furthermore, this paper faces with the possibility to overcome bad communication link conditions by resorting to device-to-device communications among users in order to lower the energy wasted and improve the convergence time of the FL process. In particular, an echo-state-network, running in local at each user site, has been considered to forecast channel conditions in a reliable manner. Performance evaluation has highlighted the improvements in convergence time and energy consumption of the proposed FL framework in comparison with conventional approaches, hence, highlighting its suitability for applications in the upcoming 6G networks.",10001759,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10001759,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10001759/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10001759/,IEEE Access,6287639,10005208,2023,2023,107,117,9,0,1042,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276044300', 'id': 37276044300, 'full_name': 'Romano Fantacci', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy']}}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086273765', 'id': 37086273765, 'full_name': 'Benedetta Picano', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Florence, Italy']}}]","['Computational modeling', 'Performance evaluation', '6G mobile communication', 'Training', 'Servers', 'Convergence', 'Privacy']","['Federated learning', 'terahertz communications', 'machine learning']","['Federated Learning', '6G Networks', 'Federated Learning Scheme', 'Federated Learning Strategy', 'Machine Learning', 'Machine-learning', 'Energy Consumption', 'Energy Expenditure', 'Learning Process', 'Channel State', 'Channel Conditions', 'Energy Waste', 'Waste-to-energy', 'Convergence Time', 'Bad Conditions', 'Bad Status', 'Bad State', 'Device Selection', 'Federated Learning Framework', 'Echo State Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Weight Matrix', 'Weight Matrices', 'Global Model', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'GDPR', 'Terahertz', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Small Base Stations', 'D2D Communication', 'Machine Learning Solutions', 'Federated Learning Model', 'Local Computing', 'Local Calculation', 'Local Training', 'Basis For Prediction', 'Set Of Devices', 'Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface', 'Mean Square Error Values']"

The BHSC is located at the interface between u-GaN and buried AlGaN. In the on-state, the holes injected from the p-GaN gate can effectively spread along the BHSC and screen the negative buffer charges. The hole spreading effect is verified by a detection of hole current from the sidewall of BHSC. The screening effect is verified by a positive substrate stress test that intentionally induces severe buffer trapping, which is widely known to cause severe dynamic  ${R}_{\text {ON}}$  degradation in traditional GaN HEMTs. However, the propose device exhibits an immunity against buffer trapping owing to the screening effect of the holes along BHSC. The dynamic performance with as short as  $\sim 20~\mu \text{s}$  delay after a 400-V substrate stress is characterized. Nearly zero buffer trap related dynamic  ${R}_{\text {ON}}$  degradation is achieved.",10001829,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10001829,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10001829/,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10001829/,IEEE Electron Device Letters,55,10027614,2023,Feb. 2023,225,228,11,0,1473,20221228,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089274975', 'id': 37089274975, 'full_name': 'Junjie Yang', 'author_order': 1, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085666504', 'id': 37085666504, 'full_name': 'Jin Wei', 'author_order': 2, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089273602', 'id': 37089273602, 'full_name': 'Yanlin Wu', 'author_order': 3, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089426896', 'id': 37089426896, 'full_name': 'Muqin Nuo', 'author_order': 4, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089703376', 'id': 37089703376, 'full_name': 'Zhenghao Chen', 'author_order': 5, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085835750', 'id': 37085835750, 'full_name': 'Xuelin Yang', 'author_order': 6, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406964400', 'id': 37406964400, 'full_name': 'Maojun Wang', 'author_order': 7, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}, {'affiliation': 'School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37269087400', 'id': 37269087400, 'full_name': 'Bo Shen', 'author_order': 8, 'authorAffiliations': {'authorAffiliation': ['School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China']}}]","['Logic gates', 'Stress', 'Substrates', 'HEMTs', 'Degradation', 'Wide band gap semiconductors', 'Aluminum gallium nitride']","['p-GaN HEMT', 'buried hole spreading channel', 'hole injection', 'buffer trap', 'current collapse', 'dynamic RON']","['p-GaN Gate HEMT', 'Negatively Charged', 'Effective Screening', 'Electrostatic Screening', 'Dynamic Performance', 'Dynamic Operation', 'Degradation Kinetics', 'Dynamic Degradation', 'Hole Injection', 'Electrode', 'Energy Band', 'Electronic Band', 'Electronic Band Structure', 'Thermal Annealing', 'Buffer Layer', 'Voltage Stress', 'Gate Region', 'High Voltage Stress', 'Metal Stack', 'Undoped Layer']"
