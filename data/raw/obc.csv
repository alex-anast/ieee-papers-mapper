0,"This paper presents a 950-MHz wireless power transmission system and a high-sensitivity rectifier circuit for ubiquitous sensor network tags. The wireless power transmission offers a battery-life-free sensor tag by recharging the output power of a base station into a secondary battery implemented with the tag. For realizing the system, a high-sensitivity rectifier with dynamic gate-drain biasing has been developed in a 0.3-/spl mu/m CMOS process. The measurement results show that the proposed rectifier can recharge a 1.2-V secondary battery over -14-dBm input RF power at a power conversion efficiency of 1.2%. In the proposed wireless system, this sensitivity corresponds to 10-m distance communication at 4-W output power from a base station.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1564343/,LOCKED,1564343,310,2,Journals,10.1109/JSSC.2005.858620,41,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1564343/,33202,1558-173X,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1564343,Jan. 2006,4,IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,2006,IEEE,1,35,A 950-MHz rectifier circuit for sensor network tags with 10-m distance,41,"[{'affiliation': 'Mobile Commun.

1,"This paper proposes a high-efficiency bidirectional integrated zero-voltage transition (iZVT) pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) converter for dc-bus and battery-bank interface. The proposed converter can operate as battery charger when the utility is within its acceptable voltage range and can supply energy to critical loads when the utility fails. The converter practically eliminates both low- and high-frequency current ripple on the batteries, thus maximizing battery life without penalizing the volume of the converter. Moreover, soft switching of all switches is achieved using the proposed integrated auxiliary commutation circuit (iACC). Just one iACC is used to provide soft-switching conditions for the three converters that compose the system: the preregulator (boost), the battery charger (bidirectional converter operating as a buck), and the backup converter (bidirectional converter operating as a boost). This auxiliary circuit has few components and low reactive energy, increasing the system's overall efficiency.

5,"This brief presents a highly integrated wirelessly powered battery charging circuit for miniature lithium (Li)-ion rechargeable batteries used in medical implant applications. An inductive link and integrated Schottky barrier rectifying diodes are used to extract the DC signal from a power carrier while providing low forward voltage drop for improved efficiency. The battery charger employs a new control loop that relaxes comparator resolution requirements, provides simultaneous operation of constant-current and constant-voltage loops, and eliminates the external current sense resistor from the charging path. The accuracy of the end-of-charge (EOC) detection is primarily determined by the voltage drop across matched resistors and current-sources and the offset voltage of the sense comparator. Experimental results in 0.6-mum 3M-2P CMOS technology indicate that plusmn1.3% (or plusmn20 muA) EOC accuracy can be obtained under worst case conditions for a comparator offset voltage of plusmn5 mV.

10,"This paper presents a compact battery-powered switched-reluctance motor (SRM) drive for an electric vehicle with voltage-boosting and on-board power-factor-corrected-charging capabilities. Although the boost-type front-end DC/DC converter is externally equipped, the on-board charger is formed by the embedded components of SRM windings and converter. In the driving mode, the DC/DC boost converter is controlled to establish boostable well-regulated DC-link voltage for the SRM drive from the battery. During demagnetization of each stroke, the winding stored energy is automatically recovered back to the battery. Moreover, the regenerative braking is achieved by properly setting the SRM in the regenerating mode. The controls of two power stages are properly designed and digitally realized using a common digital signal processor. Good winding current and speed dynamic responses of the SRM drive are obtained.

11,"A high-efficiency multimode Li-ion battery charger with variable current source and controlling previous-stage supply voltage is presented in this paper. Using variable current source can achieve the goal of constant-current mode to charge the battery and control previous-stage supply voltage which could increase the efficiency of the multimode battery charger. Moreover, the charging mode adopted in this charger is applied by two types of dual-mode strategy decided by the value of the equivalent series resistance of the Li-ion battery. This technique will reduce the damage of Li-ion battery. The Li-ion battery charger is designed with 0.35-mum CMOS double-poly four-metal processes. The experimental results show that the charger works well and the theoretical analysis can be confirmed. The average power efficiency of the multimode Li-Ion battery charger can be up to 91.2% under the average power of 1.24 W, and the accuracy of the adaptive reference voltage is up to 97.3%.

12,"Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology provides an effective solution for achieving higher fuel economy, better performance, and lower emissions, compared with conventional vehicles. Plug-in HEVs (PHEVs) are HEVs with plug-in capabilities and provide a more all-electric range; hence, PHEVs improve fuel economy and reduce emissions even more. PHEVs have a battery pack of high energy density and can run solely on electric power for a given range. The battery pack can be recharged by a neighborhood outlet. In this paper, a novel integrated bidirectional AC/DC charger and DC/DC converter (henceforth, the integrated converter) for PHEVs and hybrid/plug-in-hybrid conversions is proposed. The integrated converter is able to function as an AC/DC battery charger and to transfer electrical energy between the battery pack and the high-voltage bus of the electric traction system.

The battery charger is derived from the power hardware of the scooter, with the ac motor drive that operates as three-phase boost rectifier with power factor correction capability. The control of the charger is also integrated into the scooter control firmware that is implemented on a fixed-point DSP controller. Current-controlled or voltage-controlled charge modes are actuated according to the requirements of the battery management system, that is embedded into the battery pack. With respect to previous integrated chargers, the ac current is absorbed at unitary power factor with no harmonic distortion. Moreover, no additional filtering is needed since the pulsewidth modulation ripple is minimized by means of phase interleaving. The feasibility of the integral charger with different ac motors (induction motor, surface-mounted phase modulation motor) is also discussed, by means of a general model purposely developed for three-phase ac machines.

The environment, however, is a rich source of energy that, when harnessed, can replenish the otherwise exhausted battery.

This paper presents how a 1 × 1 mm<sup>2</sup> 0.7-μm BiCMOS vibration-supplied electrostatic energy-harvesting system IC produces usable energy. The IC charges and holds the voltage across a vibration-driven variable capacitor C<sub>VAR</sub> so that ambient kinetic energy can induce C<sub>VAR</sub> to generate current into the battery when capacitance decreases, as the plates separate.

Five legs of two IPMs are employed to construct the four-phase SRM modified Miller converter. Moreover, its front-end dc/dc boost converter is formed by the remaining one leg to boost the dc-link voltage from a battery. Proper current and speed control schemes are designed to yield satisfactory driving performance. In particular, the performance under higher speed is enhanced by the boosted dc-link voltage and the advanced shift of commutation instant. In idle case, some imbedded IPM power devices and SRM windings are arranged to form a buck-boost type or a buck-type switch-mode rectifier (SMR) for charging the battery from a utility with good charging control characteristics and a line drawn power quality. The rating derivations, performance analyses, and controller designs for these two SMRs are performed in detail.

In doing so, the circuit also increases the system's electrical damping force to draw more power and energy from the transducer, effectively increasing its mechanical-electrical efficiency by up to 78%. The system also harnesses up to 659 nJ from nonperiodic mechanical vibrations, which are more prevalent in the environment, with 6.1±1.5% to 8.8±6.9% of end-to-end mechanical-electrical efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5611629/,LOCKED,5611629,47,3,Journals,10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2077288,409,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5611629/,5643253,1940-9990,6.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611629,Dec. 2010,4156126,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems,2010,IEEE,21,400,"A 2-<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$\mu$</tex> </formula>m BiCMOS Rectifier-Free AC–DC Piezoelectric Energy Harvester-Charger IC",4,"[{'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271080800', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Dongwon Kwon', 'id': 38271080800}, {'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research Lab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271715700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Gabriel A.

21,This paper presents a modular self-controlled photovoltaic (PV) charger with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and pulse-charging schemes. The studied PV modules can be flexibly parallel connected through interleaved operation using an interintegrated circuit (I<sup>2</sup>C) interface. The MPPT control of PV panel is implemented by using a current-sensing technique with the on-state resistance of the power switch. Both an expensive hall-effect sensor and additional current-sensing resistor are not needed. A pulse-charging scheme without extra battery-current sensor is also designed to prolong the lifetime of the acid-lead battery. The operation principles and design considerations of the proposed PV charger are analyzed and discussed. A laboratory prototype is implemented and tested to verify its feasibility.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5676188/,LOCKED,5676188,20,0,Journals,10.1109/TEC.2010.2068548,289,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5676188/,5714224,1558-0059,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5676188,March 2011,60,IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion,2011,IEEE,22,281,"A Modular Self-Controlled Photovoltaic Charger With InterIntegrated Circuit ( <formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$\hbox{I}^{2}\hbox{C}$</tex></formula>) Interface",26,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278332200', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Huang-Jen Chiu', 'id': 37278332200}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270301800', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Yu-Kang Lo', 'id': 37270301800}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37872351400', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Chun-Jen Yao', 'id': 37872351400}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37403060600', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Ting-Peng Lee', 'id': 37403060600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Vehicle Engineering , National Formosa University, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37538999300', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Jian-Min Wang', 'id': 37538999300}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38107382300', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Jian-Xing Lee', 'id': 38107382300}]","['Interintegrated circuit ($\\hbox{I}^{2}\\hbox{C}$ ) interface', 'interleaved operation', 'maximum power point tracking (MPPT)', 'pulse charging', 'self-controlled PV charger']","['Batteries', 'Microwave integrated circuits', 'Pulse width modulation', 'Radiation detectors', 'Temperature sensors', 'Accuracy', 'Photovoltaic systems']"

23,"This paper studies the charging strategies of an Li-ion battery with a focus on the battery's power loss model. It is found that when the temperature is assumed constant, constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) is near optimal for energy loss minimization. However, when the temperature is considered as a state variable, an optimal profile different from CC/CV is found. This new profile can be used to warm-up batteries during cold days, hence reducing the need for existing battery heating systems. As a result of the elevated battery temperature, significant energy savings can be achieved if the vehicle is used soon after the charging process ends. In this paper, the form of the optimization problem resembles a classic form, with the peculiarity of being highly nonlinear and time varying.

26,"Micro-solar energy harvesting systems have achieved efficient operations through maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and maximum power transfer tracking (MPTT) techniques. However, they may have chargers with relatively high power thresholds, below which they have 0% efficiency. As a result, these harvesters either require much larger panels than necessary, or they fail to sustain extended periods of poor weather. To address this problem, we propose to generalize MPTT to MCZT, for Maximum Charging Zone Tracking, to expand the zones of effective charging. To cover the wide dynamic range of solar irradiation, we propose a programmable charge pump driven by a direct digital synthesizer (DDS). In addition, we dynamically reconfigure the topology of multiple supercapacitors to maximize charging efficiency and minimize voltage-dependent leakage. Experimental results from simulation and measurement show that under the high solar irradiance of 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, our MPTT part achieves 40%-50% faster charging time than one without MPTT; and under low solar irradiation of 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the boost-up operation of our system enables fully charging the supercapacitors, thereby extending the harvesting time zone from 10:00 am-07:10 pm to 8:20 am-8:00 pm even on a sunny day, all with an MPTT overhead of 1.5 mW.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6046101/,LOCKED,6046101,28,1,Journals,10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2167274,402,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6046101/,6069922,2156-3365,3.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6046101,Sept. 2011,5503868,IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems,2011,IEEE,27,391,Design and Performance Analysis of Supercapacitor Charging Circuits for Wireless Sensor Nodes,1,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37898349100', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Sehwan Kim', 'id': 37898349100}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37549133600', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Keun-Sik No', 'id': 37549133600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273472400', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Pai H.

33,"An Li-ion battery charger based on a charge-control buck regulator operating at 2.2 MHz is implemented in 180 nm CMOS technology. The novelty of the proposed charge-control converter consists of regulating the average output current by only sensing a portion of the inductor current and using an adaptive reference voltage. By adopting this approach, the charger average output current is set to a constant value of 900 mA regardless of the battery voltage variation. In constant-voltage (CV) mode, a feedback loop is established in addition to the preexisting current control loop, preserving the smoothness of the output voltage at the transition from constant-current (CC) to CV mode. A small-signal model has been developed to analyze the system stability and subharmonic oscillations at low current levels. Transistor-level simulations of the proposed switching charger are presented. The output voltage ranges from 2.1 to 4.2 V, and the power efficiency at 900 mA has been measured to be 86% for an input voltage of 10 V.

34,"This paper provides a full study of a photovoltaic (PV)-aided plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging facility by investigating the two most challenging technical issues: 1) sizing of the local energy storage (LES) unit and 2) control strategies of the facility. First, the paper proposes a method for determining the optimal size of LES for a charging facility. Second, the paper develops a control strategy for the integration of the PHEV charging stations with the proposed LES and PVs. The proposed LES-sizing method, which is based on optimal control theory, minimizes a cost function based on the average value of kilowatt-hour price, irradiance, and PHEVs' usage patterns. A power-loss/temperature-based battery model and a temperature-based charging strategy previously developed by the authors are utilized to determine the optimal LES size. Afterward, with the optimized facility parameters, a detailed circuit model of the charging facility, including PVs, PHEVs, and LES, is constructed with a real-time simulation system. While an experimental setup for this kind of complex and high-cost system was not readily feasible, real-time simulation was carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

38,"This paper first presents a hybrid-switching step-down dc-dc converter, and then, by introducing transformer isolation, a novel hybrid-switching phase-shift full-bridge dc-dc converter is derived for electric vehicle battery chargers. The proposed converter provides wide zero-voltage-switching range in the leading-leg switches, achieves zero-current-switching for lagging-leg switches, and uses a hybrid-switching method to avoid freewheeling circulating losses in the primary side. Because the resonant capacitor voltage of the hybrid-switching circuit is applied between the bridge rectifier and the output inductor for the duration of the freewheeling intervals, a smaller sized output inductor can be utilized. With the current rectifier diode of the hybrid-switching circuit providing a clamping path, the voltage overshoots that arise during the turn-off of the rectifier diodes are eliminated and the voltage stress of bridge rectifier is clamped to the minimal achievable value, which is equal to secondary-reflected input voltage of the transformer. The inductive energy stored in the output inductor and the capacitive energy stored in the resonant capacitor of the hybrid-switching circuit are transferred to the output simultaneously during the freewheeling intervals with only one diode in series in the current path, achieving more effective and efficient energy transfer. The effectiveness of the proposed converter was experimentally verified using a 3.6-kW prototype circuit designed for electric vehicle onboard chargers.

Unidirectional charging limits hardware requirements and simplifies interconnection issues. Bidirectional charging supports battery energy injection back to the grid. Typical on-board chargers restrict power because of weight, space, and cost constraints. They can be integrated with the electric drive to avoid these problems. The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive.

42,"Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. Furthermore, increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics, including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98% efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6303922/,LOCKED,6303922,145,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2012.2217354,3067,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6303922/,6376188,1941-0107,6.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6303922,June 2013,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2013,IEEE,43,3058,Mitigation of Solar Irradiance Intermittency in Photovoltaic Power Systems With Integrated Electric-Vehicle Charging Functionality,28,"[{'affiliation': 'Colorado Power Electronics Center, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38235387100', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Joshua Traube', 'id': 38235387100}, {'affiliation': 'Colorado Power Electronics Center, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38238224200', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Fenglong Lu', 'id': 38238224200}, {'affiliation': 'Colorado Power Electronics Center, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276047600', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Dragan Maksimovic', 'id': 37276047600}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37418857000', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Joseph Mossoba', 'id': 37418857000}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38466816200', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Matthew Kromer', 'id': 38466816200}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37947756900', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Peter Faill', 'id': 37947756900}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088693422', 'author_order': 7, 'full_name': 'Stan Katz', 'id': 37088693422}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37328323400', 'author_order': 8, 'full_name': 'Bogdan Borowy', 'id': 37328323400}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37585887800', 'author_order': 9, 'full_name': 'Steve Nichols', 'id': 37585887800}, {'affiliation': 'Satcon Technology Corporation, Boston, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267528000', 'author_order': 10, 'full_name': 'Leo Casey', 'id': 37267528000}]","['Battery charger', 'electric vehicle', 'energy storage', 'grid integration', 'photovoltaic system']","['Batteries', 'Inverters', 'Power generation', 'Transient analysis', 'Sensors', 'Vehicles']"

The motor winding connections are reversible by a relay-based switching device for traction and battery charging.

49,"This paper presents a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) full-bridge dc-dc converter combing resonant and pulse-width-modulation (PWM) power conversions for electric vehicle battery chargers. In the proposed converter, a half-bridge LLC resonant circuit shares the lagging leg with a phase-shift full-bridge (PSFB) dc-dc circuit to guarantee ZVS of the lagging-leg switches from zero to full load. A secondary-side hybrid-switching circuit, which is formed by the leakage inductance, output inductor of the PSFB dc-dc circuit, a small additional resonant capacitor, and two additional diodes, is integrated at the secondary side of the PSFB dc-dc circuit. With the clamp path of a hybrid-switching circuit, the voltage overshoots that arise during the turn off of the rectifier diodes are eliminated and the voltage of bridge rectifier is clamped to the minimal achievable value, which is equal to secondary-reflected input voltage of the transformer. The sum of the output voltage of LLC resonant circuit and the resonant capacitor voltage of the hybrid-switching circuit is applied between the bridge rectifier and the output inductor of the PSFB dc-dc circuit during the freewheeling phases. As a result, the primary-side circulating current of the PSFB dc-dc circuit is instantly reset to zero, achieving minimized circulating losses.

This paper proposes an innovative integrated bidirectional converter with a single-stage on-board charger to reduce the number of switches, size, and weight of the power electronic interfaces. The analyses show that 266 cm <sup>3</sup> and 1.1 kg can be saved due to the elimination of the inductor core used for power factor correction in charging mode, in addition to the reduction achieved through removal of inductor winding, power switches, diodes, and additional heat sink of the conventional structures.

Large scale unregulated deployment of either technology can have a detrimental impact on the electric grid. However, appropriate pairing of these technologies along with some storage could mitigate their individual negative impacts.

To demonstrate its usefulness, this methodology is applied to the design of optimal architectures for a residential charging case. It is shown that, given current costs, maximizing grid power usage minimizes system lifecycle cost.

The topology had never been seen in any literature or patents but is employed in the NLG5 charger made by Brusa Elektronik AG. We thoroughly analyzed the topology and thought it would be beneficial to publish it so that advanced work can be done based on the existing structure. The charger directly transfers power from the alternating current (ac) to the battery side; thus, the bulky electrolytic capacitor in a traditional two-stage charger is eliminated. Power factor correction (PFC) is inherently achieved; thus, the control becomes very simple. In addition, all the power switches work at a zero-current switching (ZCS) condition to reduce the switching loss. The charger charges the battery with a sinusoidal-like charging current instead of a constant direct current. However, this current waveform has minimal impact on the battery life and efficiency, as demonstrated by other studies. Hence, having the advantages of high efficiency, compact size, easy control, and no need of an electrolytic capacitor, the topology is suitable for the PHEV and the pure EV onboard charging applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6522201/,LOCKED,6522201,56,1,Journals,10.1109/TVT.2013.2265704,4344,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6522201/,6656889,1939-9359,9.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6522201,Nov. 2013,25,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2013,IEEE,61,4336,Single-Stage Resonant Battery Charger With Inherent Power Factor Correction for Electric Vehicles,62,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085348223', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Siqi Li', 'id': 37085348223}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan , Dearborn, MI, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085362205', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Junjun Deng', 'id': 37085362205}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan, Dearborn, MI, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548949100', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Chunting Chris Mi', 'id': 37548949100}]","['Battery charger', 'electrolytic capacitor', 'film capacitor', 'plug-in electric vehicle (EV)', 'single stage', 'zero-current switching (ZCS)']","['Capacitors', 'Batteries', 'Topology', 'Switches', 'Equations', 'Inductance', 'RLC circuits']"

62,"A hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) system consists of multiple banks of heterogeneous electrical energy storage (EES) elements placed between a power source and some load devices and providing charge storage and retrieval functions. For an HEES system to perform its desired functions of 1) reducing electricity costs by storing electricity obtained from the power grid at off-peak times when its price is lower, for use at peak times instead of electricity that must be bought then at higher prices, and 2) alleviating problems, such as excessive power fluctuation and undependable power supply, which are associated with the use of large amounts of renewable energy on the grid, appropriate charge management policies must be developed in order to efficiently store and retrieve electrical energy while attaining performance metrics that are close to the respective best values across the constituent EES banks in the HEES system. This paper is the first to formally describe the global charge allocation problem in HEES systems, namely, distributing a specified level of incoming power to a subset of destination EES banks so that maximum charge allocation efficiency is achieved. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program with the objective function set to the global charge allocation efficiency and the constraints capturing key requirements and features of the system such as the energy conservation law, power conversion losses in the chargers, the rate capacity, and self-discharge effects in the EES elements. A rigorous algorithm is provided to obtain near-optimal charge allocation efficiency under a daily charge allocation schedule. A photovoltaic array is used as an example of the power source for the charge allocation process and a heuristic is provided to predict the solar radiation level with a high accuracy. Simulation results using this photovoltaic cell array and a representative HEES system demonstrate up to 25% gain in the charge allocation efficiency by employing the proposed algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6532424/,LOCKED,6532424,37,0,Journals,10.1109/TCAD.2013.2250583,1016,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6532424/,6532341,1937-4151,7.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532424,July 2013,43,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2013,IEEE,63,1003,Charge Allocation in Hybrid Electrical Energy Storage Systems,32,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37955698400', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Qing Xie', 'id': 37955698400}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37966617700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Yanzhi Wang', 'id': 37966617700}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406976600', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Younghyun Kim', 'id': 37406976600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278158100', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Massoud Pedram', 'id': 37278158100}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278041200', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Naehyuck Chang', 'id': 37278041200}]","['Charge allocation', 'charge management', 'energy efficiency', 'energy storage system (ESS)', 'hybrid energy storage system (HESS)']","['Batteries', 'Resource management', 'Supercapacitors', 'Arrays', 'Voltage control', 'Integrated circuit modeling']"
63,"In this paper, a mode-selectable synchronous buck DC-DC converter with high efficiency and low quiescent current is proposed, which is suitable particularly for use as an Li-ion battery charger. The high efficiency is obtained by applying dynamic power management technology under light load, which makes some modules of the chip enter into sleep state and the quiescent current of the whole chip down to 45 μA. At the same time, power metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are also shut down to decrease the dissipation of the system. A simple loop compensation method is also proposed, which can eliminate the influence brought by the high equivalent resistance of the output's capacitor on the stability of the system loop. The converter has been made with a 0.5- μm complementary MOS process. Experimental results show that the peak efficiency is 94% at an output current of 100 mA when the supply voltage is 2.7 V. Moreover, the output voltage can recover within 14 μs at 400-mA load step.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6544221/,LOCKED,6544221,33,0,Journals,10.1109/TIE.2013.2267697,2285,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6544221/,6637065,1557-9948,5.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6544221,May 2014,41,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2014,IEEE,64,2278,Mode-Selectable High-Efficiency Low-Quiescent-Current Synchronous Buck DC–DC Converter,61,"[{'affiliation': ""Institute of Electronic CAD, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"", 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38101935800', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Ling-Feng Shi', 'id': 38101935800}, {'affiliation': ""Institute of Electronic CAD, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"", 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37077814200', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Wei-Gang Jia', 'id': 37077814200}]","['Buck converter', 'dynamic power management technology (DPMT)', 'loop stability', 'standby mode']",
64,"The Indian electricity sector, despite having the world's fifth largest installed capacity, suffers from a 12.9% peaking shortage. This shortage could be alleviated, if a large number of deferrable loads, particularly the high powered ones, could be moved from on-peak to off-peak times. However, conventional Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies may not be suitable for India as the local conditions usually favor inexpensive solutions with minimal dependence on the pre-existing infrastructure. In this work, we present a completely autonomous DSM controller called the nPlug. nPlug is positioned between the wall socket and deferrable load(s) such as water heaters, washing machines, and electric vehicles. nPlugs combine local sensing and analytics to infer peak periods as well as supply-demand imbalance conditions. They schedule attached appliances in a decentralized manner to alleviate peaks whenever possible without violating the requirements of consumers. nPlugs do not require any manual intervention by the end consumer nor any communication infrastructure nor any enhancements to the appliances or the power grids. Some of nPlug's capabilities are demonstrated using experiments on a combination of synthetic and real data collected from plug-level energy monitors. Our results indicate that nPlug can be an effective and inexpensive technology to address the peaking shortage.

65,"Although wireless microsensors can add performance-enhancing and energy-saving intelligence to factories, hospitals, and others, their tiny onboard sources are exhausted quickly. Luckily, coupling power inductively can both energize system components and recharge a battery. Miniaturized receiver coils, however, capture a small fraction of the magnetic energy available; thus, coupling factors kC and, as a result, power-conversion efficiencies are low. In other words, damping the magnetic source so it outputs maximum power is difficult. Investing energy into the coil increases its ability to draw power, but only when optimized. Since state-of-the-art systems can only recycle harvested energy, they are optimal only at one kC value. The inductively coupled 180-nm CMOS charger prototyped, measured, and presented here invests programmable amounts of battery energy into the pickup coil to generate 8-390 μW when kC is 0.009-0.076 and raise output power by 132% and 24% at kC's of 0.020 and 0.076, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6553248/,LOCKED,6553248,7,0,Journals,10.1109/TCSII.2013.2268353,486,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6553248/,6578080,1558-3791,8.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6553248,Aug. 2013,8920,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,2013,IEEE,66,482,Inductively Coupled 180-nm CMOS Charger With Adjustable Energy-Investment Capability,60,"[{'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA , USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270852200', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Orlando Lazaro', 'id': 38270852200}, {'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271715700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Gabriel A.

66,"Analysis of voltage regulation impacts on distribution circuits due to electric vehicle (EV) battery loads requires accurate representation of the charging system. An EV charger consists of power electronic switches with PWM control to achieve desired charging characteristics while minimizing harmonic injections to the secondary service entrance. A detailed device-level model is accurate but it requires a significant amount of time to run due to the high switching frequency of the converter. For this reason, a novel and generic model of EV battery chargers is proposed and developed for evaluating distribution voltage regulation issues. The proposed model is developed based on the average-value modeling (AVM) approach. It includes a rectifier circuit along with PWM control, boost converter and battery banks. Average dynamics of the switching circuit are obtained by averaging the effects of fast switching in the device that occur within a prototypical switching interval.

The solution here goes further in that it also supports the control of slow single-phase and fast three-phase charging through one and the same power electronic converter. A unified control methodology for the on-board chargers in electric vehicles is proposed. The control is distinguished in that it can perform four-quadrant operation while connected in single-phase or three-phase mode. The operation and network synchronization are automatically adjusted based on given terminal voltage and current measurements without the need for supplementary status signals. An analysis illustrates how the various measurements are processed for obtaining single- and three-phase flexibility while retaining compatibility with well-established methods of converter current mode control.

Periodically coupling power wirelessly is one way of replenishing onboard batteries, except that small receiver coils suffer from low coupling factors k<sub>C</sub> and induce low electromotive-force voltages. Today, receivers store and resonate incoming energy between the receiving coil and an off-chip capacitor until the voltage rises sufficiently high for a diode-bridge rectifier to steer power into a battery. The capacitor, however, requires board space and constrains the source to a particular frequency. The 180-nm CMOS power receiver presented in this paper removes the diode bridge, which establishes a minimum voltage below which the system cannot derive power, so that neither tuning nor a resonating capacitor is necessary. Experimental measurements show that the system draws power from 30-mV signals when k<sub>C</sub> is 0.0046 and coil separation is 11.35 mm, and this threshold voltage only changes 13.6 mV across 100-150 kHz, which is a 27.1% lower threshold voltage that is 36 × less sensitive than its resonating counterpart. The peak efficiency of the receiver when rectifying to 1.2 V is 82% at 224 μW and 125 kHz and average efficiency is 76% for 90-386-mV coil voltages.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6601737/,LOCKED,6601737,16,0,Journals,10.1109/JSSC.2013.2280053,2849,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6601737/,6642065,1558-173X,11.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6601737,Nov. 2013,4,IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,2013,IEEE,72,2839,180-nm CMOS Wideband Capacitor-Free Inductively Coupled Power Receiver and Charger,48,"[{'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research, Atlanta, U.S.A.', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270852200', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Orlando Lazaro', 'id': 38270852200}, {'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, and Energy IC Research, Atlanta, U.S.A.', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271715700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Gabriel Alfonso Rincón-Mora', 'id': 38271715700}]","['Contactless charging', 'inductively coupling', 'inductive power transmission', 'low-threshold rectifier', 'wireless power transfer']","['Receivers', 'Logic gates', 'Coils', 'Capacitors', 'Switches', 'Batteries', 'Magnetic resonance']"

Unlike traditional resistive load applications, the characteristic of a battery load is nonlinear and highly related to the charging profiles. Based on the features of an LLC converter and the characteristics of the charging profiles, the design considerations are studied thoroughly. The worst-case conditions for primary-side zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation are analytically identified based on fundamental harmonic approximation when a constant maximum power (CMP) charging profile is implemented. Then, the worst-case operating point is used as the design targeted point to ensure soft-switching operation globally. To avoid the inaccuracy of fundamental harmonic approximation approach in the below-resonance region, the design constraints are derived based on a specific operation mode analysis.

They have been proposed to achieve desired performance metrics of an ideal energy storage device, i.e., high energy capacity, high output power level, low self-discharge, low cost, and long service life. Implementation of appropriate charge management policies enables efficient storage and retrieval of the electrical energy, attaining performance metrics that are close to the respective best values across the constituent EES elements in the HEES system.

Precisely, the global charge replacement optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and a hierarchical algorithm is presented to efficiently solve this problem. At the top level the proposed algorithm considers the complete discharging process and allocates the load demand among all available EES banks, whereas at the bottom level it employs convex optimization methods to solve for discharging currents and the voltage level of a shared charger transfer interconnect.

82,"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) provide much promise in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, thus, are a focal point of research and development. Existing on-board charging capacity is effective but requires the use of several power conversion devices and power converters, which reduce reliability and cost efficiency. This paper presents a novel three-phase switched reluctance (SR) motor drive with integrated charging functions (including internal combustion engine and grid charging). The electrical energy flow within the drivetrain is controlled by a power electronic converter with less power switching devices and magnetic devices. It allows the desired energy conversion between the engine generator, the battery, and the SR motor under different operation modes. Battery-charging techniques are developed to operate under both motor-driving mode and standstill-charging mode. During the magnetization mode, the machine's phase windings are energized by the dc-link voltage. The power converter and the machine phase windings are controlled with a three-phase relay to enable the use of the ac-dc rectifier. The power converter can work as a buck-boost-type or a buck-type dc-dc converter for charging the battery. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a 3-kW SR motor validate the effectiveness of the proposed technologies, which may have significant economic implications and improve the PHEVs' market acceptance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6732911/,LOCKED,6732911,113,0,Journals,10.1109/TIE.2014.2304699,5731,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6732911/,6809870,1557-9948,10.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6732911,Oct. 2014,41,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2014,IEEE,83,5722,New SR Drive With Integrated Charging Capacity for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs),61,"[{'affiliation': 'Dept. of Electron. & Electr.

With the proposed variable dc link control approach, the dc link voltage follows the battery pack voltage. The operating point of the LLC converter is always constrained to the proximity of the primary resonant frequency so that the circulating current in the magnetizing inductor and the turning-off currents of MOSFETs are minimized. In comparison with conventional approaches, the proposed variable dc link voltage methodology demonstrates efficiency improvement across the wide SOC range.

84,"The continuous built-in resistance detection (CBIRD) is proposed in the switching-based charger system to achieve fast charging. Corresponding to built-in resistance (BIR) variation of Li-ion battery and charging current limitation from input energy, the CBIRD dynamically adjusts the transition voltage at the constant current (CC) mode. As a result, the transition timing from CC mode to the constant voltage (CV) mode can be postponed. Rated large charging current and extended period in CC mode effectively reduce charging time. Besides, the proposed automatic energy deliver control (AEDC) technique considers both loading system and battery status simultaneously to manage charging current according to the loading system's requirement and input supply energy for high efficiency charging. The proposed switching-based charger system was fabricated in 0.25 µm CMOS process and occupied 3 mm 2 silicon area. The charger system can save up to 40% of charging time.

85,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted growing attention in recent years. However, daily charging of EVs, in particular rapid charging, may impact power systems, especially during peak hours, and the effects may occur in different places as traffic conditions change. To address these issues, we describe an integrated rapid-charging navigation strategy that considers both the traffic conditions and the status of the power grid. The system is based on an intelligent transport system (ITS), and contains four modules: a power system control center (PSCC), an ITS center, charging stations, and EV terminals. The PSCC calculates the available charging capacity and station charging capacity based on power grid data and transmits the results to the charging stations. The charging stations determine their charging plans and estimate the available charging power for future EVs (CPFE), and transmit these data to the ITS center. After receiving CPFE data and traffic data from the ITS center, the EV terminal estimates the total time for charging (TTC) for different stations, which includes the driving time, waiting time, and charging time. The driver can view these results and choose to be navigated to the charging station corresponding to the minimum TTC. The modular design of the navigation system reduces data transmission, which protects the drivers' privacy since they can choose which charging station to use and are not required to send any data to the ITS system. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for different working conditions for power system and traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6805663/,LOCKED,6805663,110,0,Journals,10.1109/TSG.2014.2309961,1979,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6805663/,6839066,1949-3061,4.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6805663,July 2014,5165411,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2014,IEEE,86,1969,Rapid-Charging Navigation of Electric Vehicles Based on Real-Time Power Systems and Traffic Data,5,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37893837600', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Qinglai Guo', 'id': 37893837600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073254000', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Shujun Xin', 'id': 37073254000}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277694600', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Hongbin Sun', 'id': 37277694600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38180733600', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Zhengshuo Li', 'id': 38180733600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279404000', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Boming Zhang', 'id': 37279404000}]","['Charge', 'distribution network', 'electric vehicle (EV)', 'traffic control']","['Navigation', 'Vehicles', 'Real-time systems', 'Optimization', 'Power grids', 'Batteries']"
86,"While the functionality of emerging wireless microsensors, cellular phones, and biomedical implants, to name a few, is on the rise, their dimensions continue to shrink. This is unfortunate because smaller batteries exhaust quicker. Not surprisingly, recharging batteries wirelessly is becoming increasingly popular today. Still, small pickup coils cannot harness much, so induced EMF voltages v<sub>EMF.S</sub> are low. Modern receivers can resonate these low input voltages to rectifiable levels, but only with a finely tuned capacitor that resonates at megahertz when on-chip and at kilohertz when off-chip. In other words, resonant rectifiers are sensitive to frequency and dissipate considerable switching power when integrated on-chip. Unluckily, excluding the resonant capacitor requires a control signal that synchronizes switching events to the transmitter's operating frequency. The 0.18-μm CMOS prototype presented here derives this synchronizing signal from the coupled v<sub>EMF.S</sub> by counting the number of pulses of a higher-frequency clock across a half cycle during a calibration phase and using that number to forecast half-cycle crossings. This way, the prototyped IC switches every half cycle to draw up to 557 μW from 46.6 to 585-mV<sub>PK</sub> signals with 38%-84% efficiency across 1.0-5.0 cm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6812136/,LOCKED,6812136,19,0,Journals,10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2322597,271,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6812136/,7027273,2168-6785,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6812136,March 2015,6245517,IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics,2015,IEEE,87,261,"A Nonresonant Self-Synchronizing Inductively Coupled 0.18-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu $ </tex-math></inline-formula>m CMOS Power Receiver and Charger",3,"[{'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, Energy IC Research, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38270852200', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Orlando Lazaro', 'id': 38270852200}, {'affiliation': 'Georgia Tech Analog, Power, Energy IC Research, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38271715700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Gabriel A.

In this paper, we modify the min-max dispatch method to effectively integrate wind power into the grid.

By using the optimal battery capacity, the operation costs are minimized, and the hybrid system is able to dispatch the scheduled power at any dispatching time. Moreover, the short-term power dispatch control is also considered; we smooth the transient power between two consecutive dispatching intervals and control the state of charge of the battery by an online control algorithm.

91,"This paper proposes a systematic method for developing a model of a dc distribution system, based on the configuration of the system. The dc distribution system is assumed to host electric vehicles and photovoltaic modules, using dc-dc converters, and to integrate them with an ac power grid. The developed model is of the matrix form and, therefore, can be readily expanded to represent a dc distribution system of any desired number of dc-dc converters. The model captures both the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the system and includes port capacitors of the converters, as well as the interconnection cables. Thus, it can be used for identifying the condition for existence of a steady state, as well as for stability analysis. This paper further proposes an alternative set of characteristic equations that are less computationally intensive than the original matrix representation, for example, for online stability assessment tasks. The adequacy of the proposed model has been demonstrated through a number of case studies conducted and compared in the PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB software environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6850011/,LOCKED,6850011,26,0,Journals,10.1109/TVT.2014.2336854,1738,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6850011/,7106013,1939-9359,5.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6850011,May 2015,25,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2015,IEEE,92,1729,A Mathematical Model for Stability Analysis of a DC Distribution System for Power System Integration of Plug-In Electric Vehicles,64,"[{'affiliation': 'Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

The proposed charger IC integrates an analog block for battery charging, a digital control block, an analog-to-digital converter, and memory on a single chip. To improve the charging efficiency, the supply voltage of the charger IC is controlled by an adaptive low-dropout (LDO) regulator. A series-voltage feedback path is formed along the LDO regulator and multimode level shifter, which regulates the supply voltage to closely follow the battery voltage. For a smooth transition during multimode charging, we propose a new approach for built-in resistance compensation. The digital control block of the charger IC is designed in accordance with the Qi standard. The battery charger IC is fabricated in a one-poly six-metal 0.18-μm CMOS process.

93,"This paper proposes a method for enhancing the stability of a dc distribution system that integrates plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with an ac power grid. The dc distribution system is interfaced with the host ac grid via a voltage-sourced converter and can also embed photovoltaic (PV) modules. Thus, bidirectional dc-dc electronic power converters act as battery chargers and interface the PHEVs with the dc distribution system, while PV modules are interfaced with the dc distribution system via unidirectional dc-dc converters. The dc distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid, but it is prone to instabilities due to the constant-power property of the dc-dc converters. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware.

The measurement of battery impedance can be performed by the battery charger to provide an accurate equivalent model for battery management purposes. In this paper, an extended control capability of the onboard battery charger for electric vehicles is used to measure the online impedance of the battery. The impedance of the battery is measured by the following: 1) injecting ac current ripple on top of the dc charging current; 2) transforming voltage and current signals using a virtual α-β stationary coordinate system, a d-q rotating coordinate system, and two filtering systems; 3) calculating ripple voltage and current values; and 4) calculating the angle and magnitude of the impedance. The contributions of this paper are the use of the d-q transformation to attain the battery impedance, theta, and its ripple power, as well as providing a controller design procedure which has impedance measurement capability. The online impedance information can be utilized for diverse applications such as the following: 1) a theta control for sinusoidal current charging; 2) the quantifying of reactive current and voltage; 3) ascertaining the state of charge; 4) determining the state of health; and 5) finding the optimized charging current. Therefore, the benefit of this method is that it can be deployed in already existing high-power chargers regardless of battery chemistry.

The charging is from three-phase mains, and it employs exclusively the power electronic components that already exist on board the vehicle and that are mandatory for the propulsion. No new elements are introduced. Moreover, the charging is achieved without any hardware reconfiguration since the existing elements and their connections are not altered during the transfer from propulsion to the charging mode. Instead, the operating principle is based on additional degrees of freedom that exist in nine-phase machines. These degrees of freedom are employed to avoid electromagnetic torque production in the machine during the charging process, although currents flow through its stator windings. The configuration operates with a unity power factor and is capable of vehicle to grid (V2G) operation as well. A detailed theoretical analysis is given, and the control for the charging/V2G and propulsion modes is discussed.

Through the use of a passive resonant soft-commutation cell, which besides providing improvements in efficiency and reduced electromagnetic interference, produces a naturally controlled supercapacitor charger circuit. Supercapacitors are employed in order to provide a proper startup of the PEMFC and to improve its dynamic response.

The main features of the proposed solution are the use of a PEMFC as an energy storage system, which replace the battery banks commonly used in UPS systems, eliminating the common drawbacks related to working life and maintenance issues, and the use of a front-end converter with integrated PFC and dc-dc functions eliminating the necessity of using an additional and dedicated dc-dc converter for the PEMFC.

The power interface between the stationary split storage stage and the EV batteries is performed through the use of parallel-connected dual-half-bridge dc/dc converters, shifting the isolation requirements to the medium-frequency range. By choosing several different submodule configurations for the parallel connection, a multiport output concept is achieved, implying the ability to charge several EVs simultaneously without the use of additional high-power chargers. All possible charging station operating modes among with the designed necessary control functions are analyzed. The state-of-charge self-balancing mode of the delta-connected CHB converter is also introduced. Finally, the development of a downscaled laboratory prototype is described, and preliminary experimental results are provided.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6948256/,LOCKED,6948256,138,0,Journals,10.1109/TIE.2014.2367237,3222,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6948256/,7080969,1557-9948,5.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6948256,May 2015,41,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2015,IEEE,101,3213,A Modular Multiport Power Electronic Transformer With Integrated Split Battery Energy Storage for Versatile Ultrafast EV Charging Stations,62,"[{'affiliation': 'Lab. of Ind.

102,"This paper presents a multifunctional onboard battery charger for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The proposed battery charger consists of three H-bridge modules including a selective switch, a high-frequency transformer, and inductors. The first duty of the proposed charger is to charge the propulsion battery when PEV connects to the ac grid [onboard charger (OBC)]. In this case, the proposed charger plays a role in ac-to-dc converting with power factor correction. Occasionally, the propulsion battery can supply surplus energy to the grid [vehicle to grid (V2G)]. In this second task, the proposed charger acts as an inverter. The third role is to charge the auxiliary battery via the propulsion battery when PEV is in a driving state [low-voltage dc-to-dc converter (LDC)]. In this case, the proposed charger acts as a step-down converter. In conventional PEVs, the aforementioned functions are done by an OBC and an LDC separately. The proposed charger can implement the three tasks by sharing switches and inductors in an all-in-one system. Thus, the proposed approach can realize a small and light design of the EV battery charger, resulting in the improvement of fuel efficiency.

110,"Manufacturers want high power density for the on-board battery chargers of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Wide bandgap devices can be used to shrink other passive components by increasing the switching frequency, but the bulk dc link capacitor of the ac-dc power factor correction stage, becomes one of the major barriers to higher power density, because its volume depends on the ripple power at the double line frequency in a dc current charging system. However, if this double line frequency ripple flows into the battery, the dc link capacitance can be significantly reduced. This charging scheme, named as sinusoidal charging in this paper, is analyzed and implemented based on a two-stage battery charging system, which is comprised of one full bridge ac-dc stage and one dual active bridge dc-dc stage. We further find that converter loss causes ripple power imbalance and bigger dc link capacitance. Therefore, the impact of converter loss on the ripple power balance is analyzed, and a feedback control on the dc link voltage ripple is proposed based on this analysis in order to further reduce the dc link capacitance. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is verified in both Si-based and GaN-based charging systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061483/,LOCKED,7061483,201,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2015.2413815,7307,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7061483/,7219485,1941-0107,12.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7061483,Dec. 2015,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2015,IEEE,111,7299,Dual Active Bridge-Based Battery Charger for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle With Charging Current Containing Low Frequency Ripple,30,"[{'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38548623700', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Lingxiao Xue', 'id': 38548623700}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37591976800', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Zhiyu Shen', 'id': 37591976800}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274991300', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Dushan Boroyevich', 'id': 37274991300}, {'affiliation': 'University of Padova, Vicenza, Italy', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37275807000', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Paolo Mattavelli', 'id': 37275807000}, {'affiliation': 'United Technologies Research Center, Ireland', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37719955900', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Daniel Diaz', 'id': 37719955900}]","['Dual active bridge', 'GaN', 'high density', 'battery charger', 'resonant controller', 'DC link', 'Battery charger', 'dc link', 'dual active bridge', 'GaN', 'high density', 'resonant controller']","['Capacitors', 'Batteries', 'Battery chargers', 'Voltage control', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Capacitance', 'Switches']"
111,"Compactness and efficiency are the two basic considerations of the wireless battery chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid EVs. The double-sided LCC compensation topology for wireless power transfer (WPT) has been proved to be one of the efficient solutions lately. However, with the increase of the numbers of compensation components, the volume of the system may become larger, which makes it less attractive. To improve the compactness, a bipolar coupler structure with a compensation-integrated feature is proposed. The inductors of the LCC compensation networks are designed as planar-type and attached to the power-transferring main coils. Extra space and magnetic cores for the compensated inductors outside of the coupler are saved. The cost is that extra couplings between the compensated coils (inductors) and the main coils are induced. To validate the feasibility, the proposed coupler is modeled and investigated by 3-D finite-element analysis tool first. The positioning of the compensated coils, the range of the extra couplings, and the tolerance to misalignment are studied. This is followed by the circuit modeling and characteristic analysis of the proposed WPT topology based on the fundamental harmonic approximation. At last, a 600 mm × 600 mm with a nominal 150-mm-gap wireless charger prototype, operated at a resonant frequency of 95 kHz and a rated power of 5.6 kW has been built and tested.

114,"This paper proposes a new class of on-board chargers for electric vehicles (EVs). Instead of being placed on-board as a separate unit, the three-phase (fast) chargers reutilize the existing components in EVs, which are already used for the propulsion. These are primarily the inverter and the machine, which however have to be multiphase (with more than three phases). The concept is valid for all multiphase propulsion drives with a prime number of phases higher than three and a single neutral point in motoring and is illustrated in detail for the five-phase inverter/five-phase machine configuration. During the charging mode, electromagnetic torque is not produced in the machine so that the rotor does not require mechanical locking. Hardware reconfiguration between propulsion and fast charging is required, but it is achieved with only two switches, which are the only two nonintegrated elements. The integrated topology is explained in this paper, together with the control scheme, and extension from five phases to higher phase numbers is illustrated using the seven-phase system as an example. Finally, the propulsion-mode operation with complete suppression of low-order harmonics, which map into the second plane, is achieved for the five-phase machine. Experimental verification of theoretical results and proposed control is provided for both charging and vehicle-to-grid mode of operation, as well as for propulsion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7089295/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

115,"This paper proposes a novel double-grid-frequency-ripple-reducing technique for electric vehicle (EV) battery charger applications. In 1-φ EV battery chargers, due to double-frequency ripple, it is not possible to control the current using a single-power-stage approach. Hence, a two-stage approach is used. However, a bulky inductor and a capacitor are required to control the current, which adds to the system's weight and cost. The single-stage charging system described in this paper can charge the battery with almost ripple-free current without using a bulky electrolytic capacitor. At the same time, it can maintain high power factor (PF) and low total harmonic distortion on the input ac side. The proposed ripple compensation solution is realized by an innovative combination of boost and zeta converters connected in series with the battery charger, which reduces the filter capacitor value considerably. This facilitates the use of a film capacitor, which has a much longer life compared with an electrolytic capacitor. Similarly, the value of the filter inductor used in series with the battery is reduced significantly. Battery ripple current is not increased in the process; therefore, the battery life remains unaffected.

Understanding these challenges, this paper exclusively investigates the electromagnetic effects inside a surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine (SPMSM) when it is used for IC operation in electric vehicles. Variation of oscillating electromagnetic torque magnitude as a function of rotor angle is investigated through finite-element analysis, and recommendations are provided to determine the lowest torque position favorable for IC operation.

118,"This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles all charging/discharging requests from the PEV owners with different options and, at the same time, it takes into account the power demand and power generation limits of the ac grid to preclude under-voltage, over-voltage, and reverse power flow issues.

120,"Energy harvesting from natural environment gives range of benefits for the Internet of things. Scavenging energy from photovoltaic (PV) cells is one of the most practical solutions in terms of power density among existing energy harvesting sources. PV power systems mandate the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to scavenge the maximum possible solar energy. In general, a switching-mode power converter, an MPPT charger, controls the charging current to the energy storage element (a battery or equivalent), and the energy storage element provides power to the load device. The mismatch between the maximum power point (MPP) current and the load current is managed by the energy storage element. However, such architecture causes significant energy loss (typically over 20%) and a significant weight/volume and a high cost due to the cascaded power converters and the energy storage element. This paper pioneers a converter-less PV power system with the MPPT that directly supplies power to the load without the power converters or the energy storage element. The proposed system uses a nonvolatile microprocessor to enable an extremely fine-grain dynamic power management in a few hundred microseconds. This makes it possible to match the load current with the MPP current. We present detailed modeling, simulation, and optimization of the proposed energy harvesting system including the radio frequency transceiver. Experiments show that the proposed setup achieves an 87.1% of overall system efficiency during a day, 30.6% higher than the conventional MPPT methods in actual measurements, and thus a significantly higher duty cycle under a weak solar irradiance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7128333/,LOCKED,7128333,65,0,Journals,10.1109/TCAD.2015.2446937,186,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7128333/,7384660,1937-4151,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7128333,Feb. 2016,43,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,2016,IEEE,121,173,Storage-Less and Converter-Less Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting With Maximum Power Point Tracking for Internet of Things,35,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37678447300', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Yiqun Wang', 'id': 37678447300}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292036600', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Yongpan Liu', 'id': 37292036600}, {'affiliation': 'Texas Instrument, Dallas, TX, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085539807', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Cong Wang', 'id': 37085539807}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085440092', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Zewei Li', 'id': 37085440092}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085417038', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Xiao Sheng', 'id': 37085417038}, {'affiliation': 'Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37899399600', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Hyung Gyu Lee', 'id': 37899399600}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278041200', 'author_order': 7, 'full_name': 'Naehyuck Chang', 'id': 37278041200}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37291236500', 'author_order': 8, 'full_name': 'Huazhong Yang', 'id': 37291236500}]","['Energy harvesting', 'Photovoltaic systems', 'Maximum-power-point tracking (MPPT)', 'Energy efficiency', 'Storage-less and converter-less', 'Energy efficiency', 'energy harvesting', 'maximum power point tracking (MPPT)', 'photovoltaic (PV) systems', 'storage- and converter-less']","['Nonvolatile memory', 'Maximum power point trackers', 'Microprocessors', 'Switches', 'DC-DC power converters', 'Energy storage']"
121,"Wireless microsensors in hospitals, factories, and farms can manage and save lives and resources. Although tiny batteries cannot sustain them for long, harvesters can because ambient energy is abundant. Photovoltaic cells are popular in this regard because they output close to 100× more power from solar light than piezoelectric, electrostatic, and thermoelectric generators can from motion and heat. However, since mm cells can only supply μW's of the mW's that microsystems can draw, and light is not always available, battery assistance is necessary. So to supply functions and sustain operation across extended periods, the system should extract maximum ambient power, draw minimal battery assistance, and deliver as much power as possible. The 0.18-μm CMOS harvester presented here does this, draws 10-100 μW from a 3 × 3 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> cell and assistance from a battery to supply a 1-mW load and recharge the battery with excess cell power. The switched-inductor charger supply regulates 1 V within ±25 mV with 73-86% power-conversion efficiency and keeps the cell within 1% of its maximum power point.

The main contribution of this paper is empirical evidence that a fitted fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) model taking into account self-similarity of the load time series can yield high-quality short-term forecasts when H is large enough. Namely, the fitted fARIMA model uniformly outperforms regular ARIMA algorithms in terms of root-mean-square error for predictions with time horizon up to 120 min for H ≥ 0.639.

127,"Electric vehicle (EV) integration into the distribution system has been a topic of great interest lately due to the potential challenges that it poses. Previous works have focused on either centralized charge control or distributed charge control to solve these issues. In this paper, an adaptive voltage-feedback controller for an onboard EV charger is proposed, which, unlike other proposed methods, requires no real-time communication between the EV and the utility. This controller compares the system voltage at the point of charging with a preset reference voltage. EV charging is reduced as the system voltage approaches this reference. The reduced charging rate takes into account the EV battery state of charge (SOC) and the owner's end-of-charge time (ECT) preference. To validate the proposed control structure, extensive simulations are carried out on a distribution system with and without other voltage control mechanisms. Simulation results show that this method can eliminate system voltage violations that would otherwise be caused by EV charging while ensuring fairness among the various EVs, even with different system configurations and EV penetration levels. The proposed controller shows good performance in the presence of other voltage control devices and distributed generation units.

128,"The plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is a new atypical load in power systems. In future, PEV load will play a significant role in the distribution grids. This integrated load into the power grid may overload the system components, increase power losses, and affect the voltage profile in the distribution systems. Currently, the constant power load model is most commonly used for the modeling of the electric vehicle (EV) load that considers the EV loads as constant power elements without considering the voltage dependence of the EV charging system. EV load demand cannot be considered as a constant power due to the fact that modeling as a constant power load will not provide accurate information about the behavior of the charging system during the charging process. In this paper, an accurate model representing the realistic behavior of EV load is developed which is based on the ZIP load model with the ZIP parameters established through the realistic EV load data. The proposed model can be used to analyze the true behavior of the EV charger integrated to an electricity grid and determine the impacts of EV charging load on the grid. A realistic charging system was used to test and capture the EV load behavior and extract the coefficients of the EV ZIP load model, which have been verified using computer simulations and laboratory experiments. Additionally, a comparative study between the proposed ZIP load model and the constant power load model was carried out, and the results were verified with the practical EV load data.

129,"A natural evolution in public transportation vehicles is the development toward electric-driven buses (e-buses). Battery weight and volume is still a challenge in the electrification of general-purpose vehicles, but the urban bus systems have some characteristics that can be explored to address such issues. In particular, the predefined routes and stops create opportunities for reduction of onboard storage capacity through regular ultra-fast charging (R-UFC), based on chargers installed next to the boarding stations. This paper proposes a power architecture for UFC stations using the true unity power factor (TUPF) rectifier as the charger front end and interleaved dc-dc converters as the charger output. Both technologies contribute significantly to the reduction of filter components and assure high power quality standards. The proposed TUPF rectifier eliminates all harmonic orders up to the 50th, operates with low switching frequency, and does not require sinusoidal filters. The UFC stations are presented, and their investigation is carried on using computer simulations of a 400-kW application. The proposed concept is verified experimentally using a laboratory test setup.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308062/,LOCKED,7308062,12,0,Journals,10.1109/TIA.2015.2495279,1774,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308062/,7435355,1939-9367,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308062,March-April 2016,28,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,2016,IEEE,130,1766,Hundreds kW Charging Stations for e-Buses Operating Under Regular Ultra-Fast Charging,52,"[{'affiliation': 'Electr.

130,"The parallel three-level dc-dc converter has some merits over the conventional two-level buck converter when employed for fast chargers in a bipolar-dc-bus charging station. It can be directly connected to the bipolar dc bus, and can operate with the total neutral-point current eliminated under the 180°-interleaved mode, which guarantees balanced power consumption and helps decrease dc-bus voltage fluctuation. However, this incurs circulating currents, leading to increased losses and additional current stress to switching devices. To solve this issue, an integrated inductor is proposed in this paper. The inductor has an integrated magnetic core with both output and circulating windings placed on it, producing inductances to filter output currents and to attenuate circulating currents respectively. The circulating inductance can be flexibly adjusted to be much higher than the output inductance, so that the circulating currents can be well attenuated. The output and circulating inductances, along with the ratio between them, are deduced in detail. The current ripples are analyzed and compared under two operation modes with separate and integrated inductors, respectively. The weight, losses, and volume have also been compared between separate and integrated inductors.

131,"This paper aims to study the power factor (PF) correction scheme for a single-phase on-board charger of electric vehicles. The topology is based on a unidirectional current source active rectifier (CSAR) consisting of four insulated-gate bipolar transistors in series with four diodes followed by a boost converter. Buck-type rectifiers inject low-order input current harmonics into the ac mains. Thus, an inductor-capacitor (LC) input filter is employed. The capacitor's reactive energy results in a leading grid current. In order to achieve a unity displacement power factor, a phase shift control is implemented. However, the LC filter is prone to series and parallel resonances coming from the grid disturbances and the converter harmonics, respectively. Therefore, the phase shift control strategy combined with the topology of the CSAR results in a periodical resonance of the input filter. This phenomenon is studied in detail. In order to reduce the grid current's distortion level, an active damping control with resonance frequency tracking that achieves a good PF while meeting the IEC's international standards on harmonic current emissions is presented. An experimental test bench is developed to validate the simulations' theoretical findings.

In all topologies, both charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode are viable. Moreover, all are capable of unity power factor operation. A torque is not produced in machines during charging/V2G process so that mechanical locking is not required. Hardware reconfiguration between propulsion and charging/V2G mode is either not required or minimized by using a single switch. Theoretical analysis of operating principles is given, and a control scheme, applicable to all topologies and which includes current balancing and interleaving strategy, is developed.

The prototype IC, which was designed and fabricated in 250-nm CMOS, reduces capacitor charging losses by driving the buck converter with gradually increasing pulsewidths and then recycles the remaining energy by operating the buck converter in the reverse direction. The presented digital pulsewidth modulator (DPWM) supports a wide range of duty cycles from 4% to 96% with a fine resolution of 0.36% and a high switching frequency of 1.5 MHz. The optimal switching frequency and transition time that can minimize the charging/discharging losses are analyzed.

Besides the traditional grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid modes, this paper presents an improved vehicle-to-home operation mode.

When the power grid voltage is restored, the voltage produced by the on-board EV battery charger is slowly synchronized with the power grid voltage before a complete transition to the normal mode. This paper presents results of two algorithms to detect a power outage: the root mean square (rms) calculation method based on half-cycle of the power grid voltage, and the rms estimation based on a Kalman filter.

This power factor is usually regarded as unity (i.e., the ac output voltage is in phase with the current), based on fundamental harmonic approximation. However, the default unity power factor assumption is not accurate for output power derivation even at resonance frequency. This study explores not only output power factor characteristics for different frequencies or power levels, but also the phase relationships of the input and output ac voltages. The continuous conduction mode and discontinuous conduction mode are both analyzed. An integrated LCC compensation topology is selected as the research object, and its analysis process can be readily extended to other common topologies. Furthermore, this study is beneficial for the implementation of some control strategies requiring precise power computation/estimation, e.g., feedforward control or model prediction control.

In a VSM, the power converter is controlled to emulate the inertia and damping effect of a synchronous machine. Thus, a VSM-based EV charger can contribute to the spinning reserve and the frequency regulation of the power system. In case of grid outages, the VSM can seamlessly establish an islanded grid and supply local loads from the battery onboard the EV. In order to avoid the influence on the virtual inertia from power oscillations associated with a single-phase circuit, the proposed control scheme relies on a virtual two-phase system for calculating active and reactive powers.

Conventionally, boost-type PFPs are utilized to regulate the dc-link voltage at a fixed voltage; however, a variable dc-link voltage can enhance the overall efficiency of the converters. In this paper, an interleaved single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC) with coupled inductors is proposed as the PFP stage for two-stage ac/dc converters. The converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode in order to achieve soft switching for switches and diodes. The directly coupled inductors are utilized to reduce the number of magnetic components and decrease the input current ripple.

The low-frequency harmonic current is normally filtered using a bulk film capacitor or an additional active filter (AF) circuit. This presents an obstacle for improving the power density as well as reducing the cost. This paper proposes a simple and effective method that reduces the bulk capacitor in single-phase chargers and alleviates the low-frequency sinusoidal harmonic current in automotive applications. It applies the low-voltage (LV) battery charger auxiliary power module as an AF to filter the low-frequency harmonic currents in the high-voltage (HV) battery charger when the HV battery is charging. Hence, the integrated active filter auxiliary power module (AFAPM)-based dual-voltage charging system can achieve the AF function without extra power switches, heat sinks, and corresponding gate-drive circuits. In addition, the proposed AFAPM converter can obtain an almost unchanged switch rating to achieve 2.4-kW LV battery charging and 6.6-kW HV active filtering functions. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the cost for the dual-voltage charging system in electrified vehicles.

To achieve required voltage and power in propulsion systems, cascading battery stacks is essential. However, due to small discrepancies between different cells, charge imbalance occurs. Charge imbalance reduces battery cells life cycle, accessible energy, and system performance. Hence, charge equalization among battery stacks is necessary. Furthermore, EVs should have some essential requirements to provide desired contributions in future networks. Therefore, bidirectional power flow and reactive power control are other important capabilities of the battery charger system. In this paper, a bidirectional structure with two operation modes for a modular battery stack is developed.

The key components of the tag IC include an adaptive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvester, a battery access controller (BAC), a storage capacitor charger, and a powergated sensor block. External RF energy is efficiently harvested using dynamically controlled rectifying stages and a threshold-compensation technique. The BAC tightly controls the power path, cutting off leakage current from the battery. The power-gated sensor block supports multiplexed sensing operations in a power efficient manner. The sensor interface includes a chopper amplifier, a programmable gain amplifier, multiplexers, and an 8-bit ADC. For sensing data logging, custom designed nonvolatile memory is employed via one-time programmable memory.

The proposed on-board charger is composed of a step-up ac-dc converter which includes an active-clamp circuit and a series-resonant circuit. The active-clamp circuit provides a zero-voltage switching of switches and recycles the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the transformer. Also, this circuit clamps the surge voltage of switches. The series-resonant circuit reduces reverse-recovery problem of output diodes by providing a zero-current switching. Especially, the control algorithm is developed to achieve high power factor under the universal input voltage without the help of the any auxiliary circuit. Thus, due to these characteristics, the proposed charger can achieve high power efficiency and high power factor. In addition, the structure of single-power-conversion is very beneficial to the on-board charger that is installed in the vehicle.

151,"A control method that improves performance of series-resonant converters that operate with a wide input voltage and/or output voltage range by substantially reducing their switching frequency range is introduced. The switching-frequency-range reduction is achieved by controlling the output voltage with a combination of variable-frequency and delay-time control. Variable-frequency control is employed to control the primary switches, while delay-time control is used to control secondary-side rectifier switches provided in place of diode rectifiers. A series-resonant converter with the proposed control method is employed as the output stage of the on-board charger module that operates with a wide battery-voltage range. By substantially reducing the switching frequency range, the overall operating frequency is increased to reduce the sizes of the passive components, and hence, increase power density. The performance evaluation of the proposed series-resonant converter with delay-time control was done on a 3.3-kW prototype delivering energy from 400-V bus, which is the output of the power factor correction front end, to a battery operating with voltage range between 180 and 430 V.

To satisfy these needs for EVs, this paper proposes a novel battery charging system that integrates a nonisolated on-board charger (OBC) and low-voltage dc-dc converters (LDCs) by sharing the semiconductor devices and mechanical elements. Thus, the volume of LDCs is reduced dramatically compared with a conventional nonintegrated charging system. The proposed integrated system is configured based on a driving condition that is derived from the analysis of vehicle operating modes. In order to improve system's performance, an asynchronous control algorithm is applied to control the OBC optimally. In the LDC system, two LLC resonant converters are composed by sharing a transformer and secondary-side components. To increase the efficiency of each LDC, which is operated in the wide input and output voltage range, a duty and frequency control algorithm is proposed. The theoretical analysis, operating strategy, and experimental results on a 6.6-kW OBC and 1.9-kW LDC are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed system; the total volume of LDCs is 1.87 L, and peak efficiencies of OBC and LDC are 97.3% and 93.13%, respectively.

154,"In LLC-based onboard battery charging architectures used in plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), the dc link voltage can be actively regulated to follow the battery pack voltage so that the LLC converter can operate in proximity of resonant frequency and achieve high efficiencies over the wide range of battery pack voltage. However, conventional boost-type power factor correction (PFC) converters are unable to provide ultrawide dc link voltages since their output voltages should always be larger than their input voltages. This paper proposes a Silicon Carbide (SiC)-based onboard PEV charger using single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) PFC converter followed by an isolated LLC resonant converter. With the proposed charger architecture, the SEPIC PFC converter is able to provide an ultrawide range for dc link voltage, and consequently enhance the efficiency of the LLC stage by ensuring operation in proximity of resonant frequency. A 1-kW SiC-based prototype is designed to validate the proposed idea. The experimental result shows that the SEPIC PFC converter achieves unity power factor, 2.72% total harmonic distortion, and 95.3% peak conversion efficiency. The LLC converter achieves 97.1% peak efficiency and always demonstrates a very high efficiency across the ultrawide dc-link voltage range.

In this paper, a self-reconfigured integrated onboard charger architecture is proposed for PEVs to cope with this design challenge. In this architecture, the PSFB converter is adopted as the main topology to charge the high-voltage battery pack, while the half-bridge LLC resonant converter is employed to charge the low-voltage auxiliary battery. Under light-charging mode, the half-bridge LLC converter is reconfigured to be paralleled with the PSFB topology to guarantee the ZVS of the lagging leg MOSFETs. Moreover, a capacitor-diode-diode snubber is added to resolve the duty cycle loss issue of the PSFB converter and to reduce the circulating current. Practical design considerations are presented for both the PSFB and the half-bridge LLC converters. Frequency modulation and the phase-shift modulation provide two degrees of freedom to regulate the output voltage/current of both converters.

The proposed FDC EV charger uses the parameters measured from the power grid, EV charger and EV battery pack to adjust the charging current. Fuzzy logic control is used in this paper to integrate these measured parameters into the proposed FDC EV charger. As the proposed charger can be realized without a centralized control center and information exchanges between EV chargers, an FDC scheme for EV charger can therefore be effectively achieved. A prototype of the proposed FDC EV charger with a rated power of 500 W is implemented. Experimental results verify that the proposed charger can automatically adjust the charging current according to variations in the power grid and EV.

Moreover, the efficiency-to-load relationship is distinctly different for CC and CV charging operations, posing difficulties for the single-stage design. This paper describes the design of a single-stage IPT converter that complies with the battery charging profile and, at the same time, achieves optimal efficiency.

Although the snubber circuit dampens the ringing voltages due to switching, it also affect the resonance frequency which would reduce the timing of the sampling circuit, resulting in the inaccurate sampling of output voltage. By analyzing the snubber circuit and its resonance on the primary side, this paper implements a proposed accuracy knee voltage detection (AKVD) technique to compensate for the induced resonance frequency. Furthermore, the proposed constant current (CC) regulator ensures the accuracy of CC mode by compensating the sensing current error caused by the switching delay of the power transistor.

164,"In single-phase ac high-voltage (HV) battery chargers, as the input current is enforced to be varying sinusoidally in phase with the input voltage, the pulsating power at two times of the line frequency will be seen on the dc-link. Bulky capacitor bank or extra active filter (AF) circuits are needed to assimilate this harmonic current, which become a major barrier in terms of power density and cost. Sinusoidal charging method can be applied, while this might affect the charging efficiency and a deep study is still needed to further investigate on the impact to the Lithium-ion battery. An active filter auxiliary power module (AFAPM) based dual-mode dual-voltage charging system for vehicle application has been proposed. The AFAPM converter has two modes: the HV active filtering mode, in which the vehicle is connected to the grid and the converter assimilates the significant second-order harmonic current; and the low-voltage (LV) battery charging mode, in which the vehicle is running and the converter charges the LV battery from HV battery. However, a relay and inductors are still required in that converter to achieve the dual-mode operation. This paper proposes a primary full-integrated AFAPM for electrified vehicle applications with single-phase onboard chargers. The proposed AFAPM converter is composed of a two-phase bidirectional buck converter to work as an AF and a dual-active-bridge to operate as a LV battery charger auxiliary power module (APM). With the proposed converter, only an extra active energy storage capacitor is needed to achieve the active filtering. All the switches and inductors on the primary stage are shared between the AF and APM. Therefore, the use of a bulky capacitor bank or an additional AF circuit is avoided and, thus, the cost, size, and weight of the dual-voltage charging system in the electrified vehicle applications can be reduced.

169,"Sustaining microsensors for years is challenging because tiny batteries exhaust quickly, and recharging or replacing thousands of networked nodes is impracticable. Harnessing heat or light energy helps, but only when available. And even then, tiny generators output less than 300 mV, which is not enough to operate microelectronics well. This brief presents a 0.18-μm CMOS starter that charges a temporary 1.8-V supply quickly and reliably from slowor fast-rising photovoltaic and thermoelectric sources. For this, a jump starter helps an LC tank oscillate to a level that allows a discharge path to output power. A resetter then continually resets the circuit until the system senses the temporary supply is ready. This way, with 1.8 V, a charging system can then charge a battery quickly before the onset of another harvesting drought. The starter does not require off-chip components because it borrows the switched inductor that the charging system already uses to charge the battery. A prototype of the starter proposed charges 120 pF to 1.8 V in 15-59 μs with 1.5%-7% efficiency from a 180 Ω, 220-250-mV source.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7875487/,LOCKED,7875487,0,0,Journals,10.1109/TCSII.2017.2681185,160,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7875487/,8272040,1558-3791,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7875487,Feb. 2018,8920,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs,2018,IEEE,170,156,Bootstrapping and Resetting CMOS Starter for Thermoelectric and Photovoltaic Chargers,65,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37072539100', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Andrés A.

173,"Vehicle to grid (V2G) reactive power compensation using electric vehicle (EV) onboard chargers helps to ensure grid power quality by achieving unity power factor operation. However, the use of EVs for V2G reactive power compensation increases the second-order harmonic ripple current component at the DC-side of the charger. For single-phase, single-stage EV chargers, the ripple current component has to be supplied by the EV battery, unless a ripple compensation method is employed. Additionally, continuous usage of EV chargers for reactive power compensation, when the EV battery is not charging from the grid, exposes the EV battery to these undesirable ripple current components for a longer period and discharges the battery due to power conversion losses. This paper presents a way to provide V2G reactive power compensation through a boost inverter-based single stage EV charger and a DC-side capacitor without adversely affecting the EV battery. The operation of the boost inverter-based EV charger with second-order harmonic and switching frequency ripple current reduction, the dynamic behavior of the system, the transition between different operating modes, the DC-side capacitor voltage control above a minimum allowed voltage, and the DC-side capacitor sizing are extensively analyzed. The performance of the proposed system is verified using an experimental prototype, and presented results demonstrate the ability of the system to provide V2G reactive power compensation both with and without the EV battery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918621/,LOCKED,7918621,46,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2017.2700944,3471,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918621/,8248674,1941-0107,4.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7918621,April 2018,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2018,IEEE,174,3462,Single-Phase Boost Inverter-Based Electric Vehicle Charger With Integrated Vehicle to Grid Reactive Power Compensation,33,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085578485', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Damith Buddika Wickramasinghe Abeywardana', 'id': 37085578485}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37827869000', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Pablo Acuna', 'id': 37827869000}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274656700', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Branislav Hredzak', 'id': 37274656700}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37294014000', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Ricardo P.

174,"Plug-in hybrid electrical trucks (PHETs) are a kind of emerging transport solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are one of the popular choices for PHETs applications due to characteristics of rear-earth free, high starting torque, wide-speed range, and good fault tolerance. Usually, more than two converters are needed to achieve flexible energy conversion among multiple electrical energy components on board, i.e., generator, battery bank, and motor. High-power converters should be used to drive the trucks that occupy the limited on-board space. Furthermore, an extra converter is also needed to achieve ac grid connecting charging. All these converters make the on-board power electronics converter complicated. In this paper, a modular tri-port high-power converter for SRM based PHETs is proposed to combine the multiple electrical energy components into one converter. The modular tri-port high-power converter can not only support flexible energy flow, but also support parallel and series winding connections according to different conditions. Furthermore, ac grid connecting nodes are also developed in the drive, which allows the proposed converter to work as a grid connecting charger without extra facilities.

However, the supply of energy to the sensors plays a key role in the success of these applications as well as the design and deployment of these networks. Currently, most WSNs are powered by batteries, which must be replaced frequently, increasing maintenance costs and operational complexity. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, called wirelessly energy-charged (WINCH), for battery maintenance; it involves recharging sensor batteries using mobile robots. This framework integrates a routing process in which the cluster heads are selected optimally, as in the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized protocol (LEACH-C), and the robots visit the sites frequently based on need and place themselves in the optimal positions with respect to the selected cluster heads. This approach considerably reduces overhead compared with existing methods. Moreover, we have developed an empirical model of the energy charging rate for sensor nodes. We use this model to compute the amount of energy harvested by each sensor in the proximity of the mobile charger.

176,"In conventional LLC-based plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) onboard chargers, the battery pack voltage varies in a wide range with the change of state of charge. This makes it difficult to optimally design the pulse frequency modulated LLC resonant converter. Besides, the voltage regulation of the LLC converter is highly dependent on the load conditions. In this paper, a modified pulse width modulated (PWM) LLC type resonant topology (PWM-LLC) is proposed and investigated in PEV charging applications. The switching frequency of the primary LLC network is constant and equal to the resonant frequency. The voltage regulation is achieved by modulating the duty cycle of the secondary side auxiliary mosfet. Compared with the conventional LLC topology, the proposed topology shrinks the magnetic component size and achieves a wide and fixed voltage gain range independent of load conditions. Meanwhile, zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching are realized among all MOSFETs and diodes, respectively. A 100-kHz, 1-kW converter prototype, generating 250-420 V output from the 390-V dc link, is designed and tested to verify the proof of concept.

Such circuit is regarded as one candidate of the high-efficiency and high-power-density electric vehicle onboard chargers, if the double-frequency current ripple to the battery is tolerated. Instead of optimizing the overall charger, this paper is focused on adopting variable switching frequency with multiple phase shifts to accommodate the wide input range (80-260 V<sub>ac</sub>) and output range (200 V-450 V<sub>dc</sub>). In addition to the phase shift between the transformer primary-side and secondary-side voltage, one extra phase shift is added to the primary-side H-bridge when the instantaneous input voltage is higher than the reflected output, otherwise, to the secondary side. The goal is to secure zero-voltage-switching for all switches at all voltage range. Such control strategy is further optimized incorporating with the switch parasitic capacitance and deadband settings. To further enhance the charger performance, GaN HEMTs are equipped to the on-board charger aiming at higher efficiency and higher power density than Si devices.

Hence, the cross interference between RC voltages and SoC is reduced, which effectively reduces the oscillation in the estimation and improves the estimation accuracy. In addition, the adaptive algorithm is applied on the SoC submodel to improve the system robustness to noise disturbances.

The proposed methodology incorporates converter nonidealities, especially caused by magnetic components. The value of magnetizing inductance in an inductor or transformer core does not remain constant over variable current levels, which causes nonuniform power losses at different current levels. The method proposed in this paper considers a time-variant inductance over various current levels and accordingly establishes a dynamic model of loss estimation. As a proof-of-concept verification, the approach is applied to three different PFC topologies for EV applications and the estimated conversion efficiencies exhibit good agreement with experimentally obtained efficiency values over a wide range of load power from 400 W to 4.6 kW.

185,"This paper proposes an interleaved Inductor-Inductor-Capacitor resonant converter with cascaded voltage-doubler circuits for deeply depleted plug-in electric vehicle battery charging. The use of voltage double circuits extends the operating range of converter by mitigating the effects of transformer's parasitic capacitors. The converter has two modes of operation: simultaneous and independent. In the former mode both interleaving converters operate together at the same frequency and in the later mode only one converter operates. In the former mode, it yields twofold higher gain compared to the later one. Thus, operation with combined mode changing and frequency control results in wider output voltage range. For confirmation, a laboratory prototype rated at input dc voltage of 400 V and output power of 1.5 kW is designed, and implemented. The results obtained from the prototype show that converter achieves a wide output voltage range of 100-420 V when operated in simultaneous mode with simple frequency control and an output voltage range of 50-100 V in the independent mode. With combined frequency and mode changing control, it achieves an output range of 50-420 V. The peak efficiency of converter was measured to be 95.65% at a peak power of 1.5 kW.

186,"Measurements of relative displacement between the components of structural steel frameworks such as those used in large buildings, bridges, ships, and offshore platforms can be used to detect overstress or impending failure. However, current approaches used to measure displacement require complex arrays of optical sensors or strain gauges. We instead present a novel low-cost wireless 3-D embedded module that uses inductive eddy-current sensing with planar printed circuit board (PCB) coils to measure relative displacement between two or more metal plates. The module is a 50-mm cube with four faces formed by the planar PCB inductors that are used for measurement of relative displacement. The other faces and the hollow center of the cube are used for a four-channel inductive sensing IC, a microcontroller with integrated 802.15.4-compatible radio, antenna, micro-USB serial connector, battery, and battery charger/monitor. The addition of temperature and humidity sensors and a microelectromechanical system inertial measurement unit makes the module into a full structural health monitoring system that can also sense environmental factors, inclination, vibration, and shock. The module was evaluated in two axes in a custom test system that allowed controlled relative movement to two orthogonal mild steel plates, as well as inclination of the plate in a different test setup. The results show that a resolution of 0.5 mm can be achieved in both axes when measuring displacement from the planar coils to the steel plates, with negligible interference between coils/plates on the adjacent faces.

189,"A high-efficiency multimode battery charger with an adaptive supply voltage (ASV) control scheme is presented in this paper. The proposed battery charger includes a charging circuit and a dc-dc buck converter. The charging circuit automatically switches among trickle current (TC), constant-current (CC), and constant-voltage (CV) modes corresponding to the battery voltage while the buck converter with ASV control generates an ASV to closely track the battery voltage, leading to significant reduction in the power loss of the charging circuit. To further enhance the efficiency of the battery charger, zero-current detection and nonswitching control schemes are employed to decrease the power consumption of the buck converter in TC and CV modes. The battery charger was implemented with a 0.35- μm CMOS 2P4M process. The experimental results are shown to verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed charger. The maximum efficiency of the overall system is 88.3%, and the maximum efficiency improvement between the proposed charger and the conventional linear charger with fixed supply voltage is up to 11.6%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063975/,LOCKED,8063975,14,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2017.2761816,6876,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063975/,8350354,1941-0107,8.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8063975,Aug. 2018,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2018,IEEE,190,6869,A High-Efficiency Integrated Multimode Battery Charger With an Adaptive Supply Voltage Control Scheme,33,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37402099200', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Pang-Jung Liu', 'id': 37402099200}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085646351', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Lin-Hao Chien', 'id': 37085646351}]","['Adaptive supply voltage (ASV)', 'battery', 'charger', 'constant current (CC)', 'constant voltage (CV)', 'dc–dc converter']","['Batteries', 'Voltage control', 'Battery chargers', 'DC-DC power converters', 'Switches', 'Operational amplifiers', 'Power transistors']"
190,"Workplace charging of electric vehicles (EVs) from photovoltaic (PV) panels installed on an office building can provide several benefits. This includes the local production and use of PV energy for charging the EV and making use of dynamic tariffs from the grid to schedule the energy exchange with the grid. The long parking time at the workplace provides the chance for the EV to support the grid via vehicle-to-grid technology, the use of a single EV charger for charging several EVs by multiplexing and the offer of ancillary services to the grid for up and down regulation. Further, distribution network constraints can be considered to limit the power and prevent the overloading of the grid. A single mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that considers all the above applications has been proposed in this paper for a charging a fleet of EVs from PV. The MILP is implemented as a receding-horizon model predictive energy management system.

The real-world driving cycles from a fleet of connected vehicles are evaluated in an EV model with different charging options. Daily utility services are added to the simulations to explore the whole day performance of the battery and its daily degradation. Fifty driving cycles from different drivers on arterial roads are classified into aggressive, mild, and gentle drivers based on their driving acceleration behavior. The standard levels 1 and 2 chargers are considered for recharging and the frequency regulation, and peak shaving and solar energy storage are assumed for the daily ancillary services. The results indicate that the aggressive driving and recharging behavior have significant effect on the battery life reduction. In addition, the daily utility services impose extra degradation of the battery. Also, the effect of temperature change on the battery degradation is explored.

However, the structure should be compact to satisfy the wearable device requirements and the power efficiency should be as high as possible for prolonging the user experience. Besides, as algorithms embedded in these devices become more complex, the device power consumption also increases. Fulfilling these specifications in a compact structure with better efficiency is the aim of this research paper. This paper proposes a power processing module for WPT applications. This module is embedded within the WPT path to convert receiving end ac power to dc power, and to simultaneously provide multiple dc-dc power conversion for wearable medical devices. The ac-dc circuit is specifically designed using a compact topology to convert wireless ac power to stable dc power.

193,"In a conventional energy storage system in a grid-connected solar power stations, solar power is transferred to the grid through a PV-Inverter, and the battery is charged and discharged through a bi-directional converter. In this paper, a novel grid energy storage system for large-scale PV systems is discussed. With the proposed configuration, the battery charging and discharging are carried out through an AC voltage regulator which is connected in series to the line. For this system, cascaded H-bridge (CHB)-based PV-Inverter which is suitable for a high power application is selected. In case of failure in one H-Bridge of a CHB inverter, it is difficult to integrate solar inverter with the grid as the voltages of inverter and grid are not matched. Fault tolerant operation of the CHB-based PV-Inverter can also be achieved through the proposed configuration. In this paper, basic operation and control of a voltage regulator, application of the voltage regulator in grid energy storage systems, fault tolerant operation of a CHB inverter through the voltage regulator are presented.

Tiny photovoltaic cells and thermoelectric generators can help, but only when light or heat is available, and only to the extent that light intensity and thermal gradients allow. This is why energy-harvesting microsystems idle and shut down often and fast-wakeup provisions are important. The 0.18-μm CMOS charger proposed here is 8.31% more efficient during wakeup than the smallest reported and 7.69% more efficient than the next best, but without a 1:60 off-chip transformer and without vibration energy. Although 3.27% less efficient than the most efficient, the system here uses three fewer off-chip inductors. And after waking, the system is 5% to 46% more efficient than the others.

Three of those modes are applied for driving and the others for charging. During the driving mode, the topology can be converted to a fourlevel one. During the charging mode, two battery packs are charged in parallel with the boost circuit by the external ac source or generators. The main contributions of the proposed topology are as follows. First, a four-level converter is formed by adopting different ways of connection (series or parallel) of the two battery packs (or the two capacitors), which can accelerate the excitation and demagnetization procedures of SRMs. Moreover, the topology contributes to decreasing the switching losses and extending the constant torque region to improve the drive performance as well. Second, the state of charge of the two battery packs (or the voltages of two capacitors) can keep balance on their own by parallel operation of the two battery packs.

Fluctuations of solar energy harvested due to atmospheric conditions can be mitigated through energy storage systems (ESS). Solar energy can also be used to charge electric vehicle batteries to reduce the dependence on the grid. One of the requirements for a converter for such applications is to have a reduced number of conversion stages and provide isolation. The Z-source inverter (ZSI) topology is able to remove multiple stages and achieve voltage boost and dc-ac power conversion in a single stage. The use of passive components also presents an opportunity to integrate ESS into them.

199,This paper proposes a torque cancellation strategy for a nonisolated three-phase integrated battery charger topology for light and medium duty electric vehicle drives based on six-phase permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machines. The charger requires a three-phase grid interface and utilizes the machine windings as the input filter inductances after minor reconfiguration. The drive power electronics are used to control the currents drawn from the three-phase grid. The current flowing through the machine windings induces a torque on the PM machine rotor which is eliminated by the proposed torque cancellation strategy in battery charging mode. The torque cancellation strategy is general and works with both symmetric and asymmetrically wound six-phase PM machines. The strategy is also capable of eliminating the torque when the rotor is displaced from the stator d-axis. The linear quadratic regulator with the integral action control scheme is used to accommodate for the asymmetry caused by the dependence of winding inductance on the rotor position. Co-simulation results with Finite-Element Analysis and hardware experiments show the topology based on six-phase PM machines can be used to charge or discharge the battery for grid support functions while the torque on the machine shaft remains canceled.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8244322/,LOCKED,8244322,22,0,Journals,10.1109/TTE.2017.2788190,354,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8244322/,8373763,2372-2088,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8244322,June 2018,6687316,IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification,2018,IEEE,200,344,Torque Cancelation of Integrated Battery Charger Based on Six-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drives for Electric Vehicles,4,"[{'affiliation': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085511347', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Syed Qaseem Ali', 'id': 37085511347}, {'affiliation': 'Canadian National Railway Company, Montreal, QC, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37071859900', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Diego Mascarella', 'id': 37071859900}, {'affiliation': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270090600', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Geza Joos', 'id': 37270090600}, {'affiliation': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085622570', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Longcheng Tan', 'id': 37085622570}]","['Electric vehicles (EVs)', 'fast chargers', 'integrated battery chargers (IBCs)', 'plug-in EVs', 'synchronous machine']","['Torque', 'Topology', 'Rotors', 'Windings', 'Stator windings', 'Batteries']"
200,"In electric vehicles with rooftop PV panels, the solar irradiance and surface temperature can affect their performance and output voltages (e.g., V<sub>pv</sub> = 24-45 V<sub>dc</sub>). In these systems, the maximum energy must be extracted from the variable input voltage (PV panel), boosted by different gains, and stored in high-voltage battery packs. Furthermore, depending on the battery state of charge, the charger should operate in constant voltage, constant current, or constant power modes, all the way from complete discharge condition, up to the charged floating voltage phase (V<sub>bat</sub> = 230-430 V<sub>dc</sub>). This combination of the variable PV input voltage and different states of charge creates a significant regulation challenge for the converter. In this paper, a high-efficiency fourth-order L3C resonant converter is proposed with an extreme voltage regulation capability that can effectively extract the maximum power from the PV panels and respond to the battery states of charge at different voltage and current levels.

The power path controller (PPC) functions as a power monitor and selects the optimal path for charging either via an energy harvesting system or an ac adapter. The step-down dc-dc converter provides an initial supply voltage to start up the energy harvesting system. The integrated circuit design is implemented on a CMOS 0.18 μm technology process. Experimental results verify that the proposed pulse charger reduces the charging time of 100 mAh and 45 mAh Li-ion batteries respectively by 37.35% and 15.56% and improves the charge efficiency by 3.15% and 3.27% when compared to the benchmark constant current-constant voltage charging technique.

202,"This paper proposes a hybrid electronic and magnetic structure named a variable-inverter-rectifier-transformer (VIRT) that enables a transformer with fractional and reconfigurable effective turns ratios (e.g., 12:0.5, 12:2/3, 12:1, and 12:2). This functionality is valuable in converters with wide operating voltage ranges and high step-up/down, as it offers a means to reduce the turns count and copper loss within the transformer while also facilitating voltage doubling and quadrupling. These properties are especially beneficial for miniaturizing the transformer stage in many power electronics applications, such as universal serial bus wall chargers. We introduce the principle of operation of the structure and present models for its magnetic and electrical behavior. The instance of VIRT described in this paper comprises four half-bridge switching cells distributed around a planar magnetic core and connected to two “half-turns” wound through that core. By controlling the operating modes of the half-bridge cells, we gain control over the flux paths and current paths used in the transformer, and this hybridization enables fractional and reconfigurable effective turns ratios.

204,"The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of emerging technologies for modular power converter architectures for electric vehicles. Nowadays, the most common electrical drive-train architecture exhibits one single inverter which is directly tied to the battery. As a consequence, only one high-voltage battery module can be applied and the dc-link voltage of the inverter and its apparent power rating is directly dependent on the available battery voltage. To overcome this restriction, modern power converter architectures with a higher degree of freedom have been proposed. These architectures exhibit modular dc-dc converters to allow different battery technologies to be linked to drive inverters operating independently from each other. To make this development feasible, new components and technologies are evolving which enhance the efficiency over mission cycles while ensuring further integration of the power-converter architectures. Wide-bandgap power semiconductors enable high switching frequencies and miniaturization of passive devices. Smart topology enhancements and control methods allow a significant loss reduction, in particular at light loads, resulting in a higher efficiency of the drive train over the entire driving cycle. Highly integrated bidirectional battery charger systems with intelligent charging strategies inhibit battery degradation and provide opportunities for grid stabilization.

Furthermore, by adopting the HV partial current control technique, the charging current at the CC stage can be regulated only by sensing part of inductor current.

208,"A full-bridge LLC resonant converter with series-parallel connected transformers for an onboard battery charger of electric vehicles is proposed, which can realize zero voltage switching turn-on of power switches and zero current switching turn-off of rectifier diodes.

209,"In this paper, a metal object detection (MOD) system, a kind of foreign object detection (FOD), which is based on mistuned resonant circuits and utilizes the variation of self-inductance of a sensing pattern, is newly proposed for wireless electric vehicle (EV) chargers. The sensing pattern that consists of multiple loop coil sets is mounted on the transmitting (Tx) pad of an EV charger, where a loop coil set has two coils connected in series with the opposite polarity to cancel out the induced voltage generated by the Tx coil. Variation of self-inductance of the loop coil set is detected by a parallel-resonant circuit, driven by a current source and operating at near 1 MHz, in order to enhance the resolution of the proposed MOD system. To increase the detection sensitivity of the proposed MOD system, instead of an exact resonant frequency, a mistuned operating frequency near the -3 dB point is utilized for the parallel-resonant circuit. In this way, the proposed MOD system can detect very small metal objects regardless of their position and orientation on the Tx coil without any blind zone. Through simulations and experiments, it is found that the proposed MOD system detects not only horizontal but also standing upright metal objects. A prototype MOD system, operating at 85 kHz to satisfy the standard J2954, was fabricated to verify its feasibility. The results showed that output voltage change of the proposed MOD system becomes 22.7% for a piece of the aluminum foil of 3 × 3 cm<sup>2</sup> and 40.9% for 100 Korean Won coin.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309279/,LOCKED,8309279,39,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2018.2813437,758,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8309279/,8550820,1941-0107,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8309279,Jan. 2019,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2019,IEEE,210,748,Self-Inductance-Based Metal Object Detection With Mistuned Resonant Circuits and Nullifying Induced Voltage for Wireless EV Chargers,34,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085388230', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Seog Y.

210,"Compared to conventional electrical-vehicle(EV) on-board chargers utilizing a front-end Power-Factor-Correction(PFC) + an isolated DC/DC converter, which limits the wall-to-battery efficiency to ~94%, a new control strategy using variable switching frequency(VSF) and variable phase shifts frees the PFC stage thereby getting rid of the DC link capacitor and further increasing the system efficiency and power density. The challenge is to secure zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on for all switches within the full-power range. In this paper a novel VSF single-dual-phase-shift(SDPS) control strategy is proposed, which consists of three control freedoms, i.e., two phase shifts and one variable switching frequency to secure ZVS and achieve PFC simultaneously. ZVS boundaries are pictured and compared among single-phase-shift(SPS), dual-phase-shift(DPS) and the proposed single-dual-phase-shift(SDPS) control.

In some application such as a battery charger, the data exchanges between the primary and secondary sides are necessary. In the conventional system, an additional line or wireless communication modules is used for data exchanges, thereby increasing the system and connector size. The proposed system, in comparison, does not use additional signal transceiver but instead exchanges data by simply alternating operation mode of the flyback converter, thus adding communication function while not increasing the volume of the terminal and overall system. The waveform of transformer voltage is used to count the number of resonant pulses, which is used for decoding and encoding the data packet. Bidirectional communication between primary and secondary sides is possible while power is transferred to the output using an appropriate communication protocol.

213,"Charging electric vehicles (EVs) from photovoltaic panels (PV) provides a sustainable future for transportation. This paper presents the development of a 10 kW EV charger that can be powered from both a PV array and the three-phase ac grid. The goal is to realize a high power density and high-efficiency three-port power converter that integrates the EV, PV, and grid and meets the Chademo and combined charging standard/Combo EV charging standards. The EV port is designed to be isolated and bidirectional, so that both charging and vehicle-to-grid can be implemented. As PV and EV are both dc by nature, the converter uses a central dc link to exchange power between the EV and PV, thereby increasing efficiency. The use of silicon carbide devices and powdered alloy core inductors enables high switching frequency and power density. The closed-loop control allows four different power flows: PV → EV, EV → grid, grid → EV, and PV → grid. Hence, the converter operates as a PV inverter, a bidirectional EV charger, and a combination of both.

214,"In this paper, a controller design methodology is proposed for a CLLLC-type bidirectional resonant converter. The soft switching of all devices in this topology and the very high operating frequency lead to increased overall system efficiency. However, the dynamic nature of this converter is highly dependent on loading conditions, which proves challenging when designing the voltage and current closed-loop controllers. System instability is mainly due to the high-Q resonant peaking, which is observed in the open-loop bode-plots. In this paper, the controller design methodology is proposed, which accounts for the dynamics behavior due to load variations. The controller stability will be evaluated against the entire range of operating switching frequency. Both battery charging and regeneration modes will be described and analyzed. The focal contribution of this paper will focus on defining the worst operating scenarios for the converter using system-level modeling and analysis. In addition, the controller will be defined based on these operating points. To validate and verify the controller design methodology proposed, a 3.5-kW converter is designed with the appropriate output voltage and current loop controllers.

The proposed battery charger accurately detects the built-in resistance (BIR) and determines the transition point from the constant-current (CC) to constant-voltage (CV) modes. It then maximizes and minimizes the durations of the CC and CV modes, respectively, thus reducing the battery charging time. In addition, the proposed charger accurately controls the charging current (I<sub>BAT</sub>) by employing an adaptive OFF time-controlled switching charger. The proposed battery charger was fabricated using a 0.18-μm standard CMOS process. The measurement results showed that with the use of the accurate BIR detection and adaptive OFF-time-control methods, the proposed charger reduced the total charging time by up to 41.2% and achieved I<sub>BAT</sub> ripple of 52 mA<sub>p-p</sub>.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8350334/,LOCKED,8350334,9,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2018.2830747,10054,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8350334/,8468129,1941-0107,12.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8350334,Dec. 2018,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2018,IEEE,216,10051,A Fast and Highly Accurate Battery Charger With Accurate Built-In Resistance Detection,33,"[{'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086458242', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Young-Ho Jung', 'id': 37086458242}, {'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086460345', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Jae-Hyung Jung', 'id': 37086460345}, {'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086458844', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Hoe-Eung Jeong', 'id': 37086458844}, {'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086460348', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Jae-Hoon Jung', 'id': 37086460348}, {'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085837335', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Jae-Sung An', 'id': 37085837335}, {'affiliation': 'Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085880867', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Hyun-A.

216,"Existing charging techniques for lithium-ion batteries use a largely open-loop approach, where the charge profile is predecided based on a priori knowledge of cell parameters. There is a need for closed-loop charging techniques that use instantaneous cell voltage and/or temperature to modulate the charging current magnitude. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a constant-temperature constant-voltage (CT-CV) charging technique, considering cell temperature as a key degradation metric. The proposed CT-CV charging scheme employs a simple and easy-to-implement proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller aided by a feed-forward term. The charging current is dynamically adjusted in response to the battery temperature, which indirectly reflects its aging and thermal environment. As per experimental results, the proposed method achieves 20% faster charging with the same total temperature rise as constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) technique. Alternatively, it causes 20% lower cell temperature rise for given total charge time. It can easily accommodate applications that demand even faster charging by simply raising the set temperature. This paper establishes the benefits of the proposed CT-CV charging at cell level and raises the possibility of extending it to the pack level by integrating it with battery management systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353785/,LOCKED,8353785,49,0,Journals,10.1109/TIE.2018.2833038,1067,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353785/,8478009,1557-9948,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8353785,Feb. 2019,41,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2019,IEEE,217,1059,A Closed-Loop Constant-Temperature Constant-Voltage Charging Technique to Reduce Charge Time of Lithium-Ion Batteries,66,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086143668', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Lalit Patnaik', 'id': 37086143668}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085788542', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'A.

223,"This paper outlines a battery charging strategy to reduce charging losses in a lithium-ion battery for electric vehicles. The proposed charging strategy utilizes an adaptive current profile based on variations of the battery internal resistance as a function of the state of charge and the charge rate. To address the problem of finding the optimal current set for the proposed strategy, an evolutionary algorithm, which is a type of stochastic approach, is applied. A strategy for selecting the optimal number of charging intervals is also presented to reach a compromise between loss reduction and computational burden. Experimental results obtained using 34-Ah lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide battery cells have proved that the proposed charging strategy decreases the charging loss of the battery cell by 40.1% compared with a conventional constant-current charging strategy. Furthermore, a 3.3-kW on-board charger prototype has been built to investigate the total loss reduction in an electric vehicle charging system that includes a 12-kWh battery pack. The proposed adaptive-current charging strategy reduces the total charging losses including both battery loss and charger loss of electric vehicles by 7.2%, 11.2%, and 21.2% in charging systems with power ratings of 3.3 kW, 6.6 kW, and 13.2 kW, respectively.

227,"With an aim to decrease pollution level due to aviation transportation sector, aircraft industries are focusing on more electric aircraft (MEA). The design of MEA is made with an aim to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emission, noise pollution, increased comfort level for the passengers, and so on. In this paper, a detailed study of the evolution of the MEA along with the load profile for electrical load is presented. Based on the requirements of the electrical load, a high-energy-density lithium-ion “Li iron phosphate”battery is selected, designed, and modeled. The modeling is based on the modified Shepherd curve-fitting model with the addition of the voltage polarization term to have a lower complexity and more proximity with the real battery profile. The phase shifted high power bidirectional dc-dc (PSHPBD) converter is used in the battery energy storage system (BESS) as a battery charger. The modeled Li-ion battery is integrated to the 270-V<sub>dc</sub> MEA power distribution bus using the optimal harmonic number-based harmonic model of the PSHPBD converter. Since BESS has to provide the transient loads, the fast dynamic response is required for the PSHPBD converter working as the charger in the BESS. A predicted peak current-based fast response control technique is proposed in this paper for the integration of the BESS with an MEA power system architecture.

228,"The momentum toward high power density high-efficiency power converters continues unabated. The key to reducing the size of power converters is high-frequency operation and the bottleneck is the magnetic components. With the emerging widebandgap devices, the switching frequency of power converters increases significantly, to hundreds of kilohertz, which provides us the opportunity to adopt printed circuit board (PCB) winding planar magnetics. Compared with the conventional litz-wire-based magnetics, planar magnetics can not only effectively reduce the converter size, but also offer improved reliability through automated manufacturing process with repeatable parasitics. Another way to reduce the number of magnetic components and shrink the size of power converters is through the magnetic integration. In this paper, a novel PCB winding based magnetic structure is proposed to integrate both inductor and transformer into one component. In this structure, the inductor value can be easily controlled by changing the cross-sectional area of the core or the length of the air gap.

The OBC is operated in three different modes by sharing the transformer, switches, and capacitors. For a grid-to-vehicle mode or a vehicle-to-grid mode, the LV battery charging circuit serves as an active filter to eliminate the low-frequency power ripple at the DC link. Thus, the small film capacitors can be employed instead of large capacitors at the DC link. For the third operating mode, where the LV battery is charged from the HV battery, the isolation is provided by the dual active bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter. Since some components in the proposed OBC are used in common, the size and cost of the OBC can be reduced significantly.

231,"The 3-phase windings of interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) used in electric vehicles (EVs) for traction can also be utilized for charging a battery. This integrated charging technology eliminates the on-board charger, leading to a significant reduction in the overall weight and cost of the EV. However, during integrated charging, the induced magnetic fields across the IPMSM windings are unbalanced, which could lead to addition of harmonic current components at the battery side, demagnetization, noise, and vibrations. This paper provides a novel design solution by implementing asymmetrical damper bars in the IPMSM rotor to mitigate unbalanced magnetic fields during integrated charging, and, thus, overcome the aforementioned issues. However, the bars introduced could affect the useful torque production of the machine during traction. Therefore, a magnetic equivalent circuit model based differential evolutionary algorithm is proposed and implemented to optimize the IPMSM rotor structure with dampers to achieve balanced magnetic fields during integrated charging operation and satisfactory traction performance.

236,"In this paper, a dual-channel isolated magnetically integrated charger is proposed for electric vehicles (EVs). The key is to apply and operate two interleaved power charging channels, each of which is composed of one dual-active-bridge isolated converter and one voltage-source inverter. The proposed configuration not only offers electric isolation under charging operation but also provides modular design and operation for each power conversion channel. By integrating the grid inductances with the double-stator-winding permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machine under charging operation, the volume and weight of the charging system are saved for EVs. By reconfiguration of power circuits, the proposed dual-channel magnetically integrated EV chargers can be used for both single-phase and three-phase charging operations. The mechanical vibration caused by interaction between grid currents and PM flux can be mitigated by using the dual-channel charging operation. The interleaved operation and the phase-shifted modulation have been proposed for the dual charging channels to offer low current ripple on battery side and better harmonic performance on grid side. Furthermore, chaotic modulation strategies have been proposed to reduce the distinct switching harmonics in spectrum, which will facilitate improving the conducted electromagnetic compatibility in EVs. The experiments have been carried out on a 1-kW laboratory prototype to verify the validity of the proposed schemes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8526322/,LOCKED,8526322,17,0,Journals,10.1109/TIA.2018.2879869,1953,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8526322/,8651608,1939-9367,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8526322,March-April 2019,28,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,2019,IEEE,237,1941,A Dual-Channel Magnetically Integrated EV Chargers Based on Double-Stator-Winding Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machines,55,"[{'affiliation': 'Southeast University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279253500', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Zheng Wang', 'id': 37279253500}, {'affiliation': 'Southeast University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086539261', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Bochen Liu', 'id': 37086539261}, {'affiliation': 'Southeast University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086540459', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Lei Guan', 'id': 37086540459}, {'affiliation': 'Southeast University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085745228', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Yue Zhang', 'id': 37085745228}, {'affiliation': 'Southeast University, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272480000', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Ming Cheng', 'id': 37272480000}, {'affiliation': 'South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37279402100', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Bo Zhang', 'id': 37279402100}, {'affiliation': 'Aviation Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Aero Electromechanical System Integration, Nanjing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085472448', 'author_order': 7, 'full_name': 'Liang Xu', 'id': 37085472448}]","['Conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI)', 'double-stator-winding machine', 'electric vehicles (EVs)', 'harmonics', 'magnetically integrated charger (MIC)']","['Microwave integrated circuits', 'Windings', 'Inverters', 'Batteries', 'Stator windings', 'Switches', 'Torque']"

241,"With superior loss characteristics, wide bandgap devices such as silicon carbide (SiC) mosfets are expected to replace Si-IGBTs in grid-connected applications. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an application in which low conduction-loss and switching-loss from SiC devices can largely improve the system efficiency. However, fast switching of an SiC mosfet worsens the electromagnetic interference (EMI). In addition, the UPS is comprised of multiple converters wherein different combinations of the converters take part in power-transfer depending on the mode of operation. This complicates the prediction and strategies for noise, especially the common-mode (CM) part. Such complexity calls for deliberate strategies to be set before prototyping to contain and mitigate the CM noise. In this paper, a three-terminal CM circuit model is presented for a three-phase UPS with an active battery charger and a battery rack. The significance of a dc-dc converter on CM EMI generation and propagation has been analyzed based on the model. In a mode of operation where the dc-dc converter is active, a considerable amount of the CM noise is generated from the dc-dc converter. Also, the multiple resonances on the propagation path associated with dc inductors and the battery rack highly deteriorates CM EMI. As a mitigation strategy in the design phase, different topologies and pulsewidth modulation schemes for the ac-ac stage and the dc-dc stage have been compared based on the model. A 20-kW full-SiC UPS has been built and tested to experimentally verify the impact of the dc-dc converter operation on the noise and to validate the mitigation strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550770/,LOCKED,8550770,14,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2018.2883714,8612,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550770/,8736077,1941-0107,9.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8550770,Sept. 2019,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2019,IEEE,242,8599,"Three-Terminal Common-Mode EMI Model for EMI Generation, Propagation, and Mitigation in a Full-SiC Three-Phase UPS Module",34,"[{'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085993482', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Sungjae Ohn', 'id': 37085993482}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085866474', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Jianghui Yu', 'id': 37085866474}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086542696', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Paul Rankin', 'id': 37086542696}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085434530', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Bingyao Sun', 'id': 37085434530}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270043300', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Rolando Burgos', 'id': 37270043300}, {'affiliation': 'Center for Power Electronics Systems, Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274991300', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Dushan Boroyevich', 'id': 37274991300}, {'affiliation': 'ABB US Corporate Research, Raleigh, NC, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37061015100', 'author_order': 7, 'full_name': 'Harish Suryanarayana', 'id': 37061015100}, {'affiliation': 'ABB Power Solutions, Richmond, VA, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086142248', 'author_order': 8, 'full_name': 'Christopher Belcastro', 'id': 37086142248}]","['AC–AC conversion', 'ac–dc conversion, electromagnetic interference (EMI)', 'uninterruptible power supply (UPS)', 'wide-bandgap devices (WBG)']","['Electromagnetic interference', 'Uninterruptible power systems', 'Batteries', 'DC-DC power converters', 'Rectifiers', 'Inverters', 'Integrated circuit modeling']"

In this paper, a high-accuracy constant output current/constant output voltage (CC/CV) ac-dc flyback converter is proposed and a novel cable compensation method without external capacitor is put forward.

This method eliminates the need of external capacitor, reducing cost and increasing reliability of the converter. In CC mode, the switching period is adjusted to be fixed multiple of the demagnetization time, thereby realizing the constant current output. The control chip was implemented in NEC 1 μm HVCMOS process, and a 5-V/1-A prototype has been built to verify its feasibility.

244,"With new developments in power electronics and semiconductor devices, there has been an increasing interest in the adoption of power electronic traction transformer (PETT) topologies in railways, mainly for the purpose of mass and volume reduction against conventional topologies. Apart from traction transformers, examples include isolation circuits for on-board auxiliary power units (APU) and even 750 V<sub>DC</sub>, 110 V<sub>DC</sub> and lower voltage (e.g., 72 V<sub>DC</sub>) battery chargers. Special attention has been given to the more mature technology of three-stage (ac-dc-MFac-dc) configurations with intermediate medium frequency ac (MFac) links. In contrast to conventional architectures, it becomes difficult to select a suitable multistage topology of power electronics for the design of complex traction systems with advanced requirements.

245,"Operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in large spatiotemporal missions is currently challenged by onboard energy resources requiring manned support. With current methods, AUVs are programmed to return to a static charging station based on a threshold in their energy level. Although this approach has shown success in extending the operational life, it becomes impractical due to interruption of AUV operation and loss of energy needed to return to charging station. It is also not practical for large networks due to shortage of charging stations. We introduce mobile onsite power delivery, which will fundamentally change the range and duration of underwater operations. This letter presents a mission planning method to generate mobile charger trajectories, given pre-defined working AUV trajectories, considering environmental constraints such as currents and obstacles. The problem is formulated as a multiple generalized traveling salesman problem, which is then transformed into a traveling salesman problem. Energy cost in dynamic currents is integrated with a path planning algorithm using a grid-based environment model. A scheduling strategy extends the problem over multiple charging cycles. Simulation results show that the planning method significantly improves mission success and energy expenditure. Field experiments in Lake Superior using two types of AUVs, an unmanned surface vessel, and a manned support vessel validate the feasibility of the planned trajectories for long-term marine missions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8632742/,LOCKED,8632742,12,0,Journals,10.1109/LRA.2019.2896899,1660,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8632742/,8581687,2377-3774,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8632742,April 2019,7083369,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,2019,IEEE,246,1653,Rendezvous Planning for Multiple AUVs With Mobile Charging Stations in Dynamic Currents,4,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086211507', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Bingxi Li', 'id': 37086211507}, {'affiliation': 'Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085876938', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Brian R.

This converter has the inductor placed at the input with a smaller voltage swing, leading to possible use of a smaller inductor and low-voltage rating switches that generally translate to reduced conduction losses. Analyses of converter operation and losses to reveal its original characteristics and design guidelines are presented to facilitate the components optimization. The converter architecture is verified by a proof-of-concept 15-W inductor-less lithium-ion battery charger prototype that uses a 1-m USB 3.0 cable as inductor.

A galvanic isolated hard-switching full-bridge converter that operates in constant-current mode is analyzed, confirming that leakage inductance significantly affects the small-signal model, and the influence of leakage inductance can be equivalent to a resistance in series with the converter's output LC filter just as that in phase-shifted full-bridge converter. However, the same leakage inductance in these both converters will lead to different equivalent resistance due to different operating principles.

249,"In this paper, a phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converter employing a new center-tapped clamp circuit is proposed to achieve high efficiency and high power density in electric-vehicle battery charger applications. By using a simple center-tapped clamp circuit, which consists of two diodes and one capacitor, many limitations in conventional PSFB converters are solved. The proposed center-tapped clamp circuit provides the clamping path and allows the secondary voltage stress to be clamped to the secondary-reflected input voltage. This results in a greatly reduced conduction loss in the secondary full-bridge rectifier (FBR) due to the low-forward-voltage drop of low-voltage-rated diodes, and the resistor-capacitor-diode snubber loss is eliminated. In addition, the circulating current in the primary side is removed without any duty-cycle loss. Furthermore, the turn-off switching loss in the FBR is substantially reduced due to the decreased reverse-recovery current and the reduced reverse voltage. With these advantages, high efficiency can be achieved. Besides, the size of the output inductor is considerably reduced with the aid of clamping voltage, resulting in a high power density with saving the cost. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a 3.3-kW prototype was tested. Experimental results show that the proposed converter achieves high efficiency over the entire conditions with high power density.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8643533/,LOCKED,8643533,28,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2019.2899960,10959,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8643533/,8824237,1941-0107,11.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8643533,Nov. 2019,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2019,IEEE,250,10945,Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge DC–DC Converter With High Efficiency and High Power Density Using Center-Tapped Clamp Circuit for Battery Charging in Electric Vehicles,34,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085341694', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Cheon-Yong Lim', 'id': 37085341694}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37073095400', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Yeonho Jeong', 'id': 37073095400}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277729800', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Gun-Woo Moon', 'id': 37277729800}]","['Circulating current', 'clamp circuit', 'electric vehicle (EV)', 'on-board battery charger (OBC)', 'phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converter', 'zero-voltage and zero-current switching (ZVZCS)']","['Clamps', 'Capacitors', 'Density measurement', 'Power system measurements', 'Batteries', 'Inductors', 'Schottky diodes']"

254,"The reverse LLC voltage gain is lower than unity. The dc-link voltage is then lower than the peak grid voltage so that the buck type dc-ac converters cannot be grid-tied directly, which causes the LLC reverse operation difficult in bidirectional application. This paper proposes a silicon carbide (SiC) bidirectional LLC charger architecture to achieve high efficiency and high power density. The first stage is an interleaved bridgeless totem pole power factor correction (PFC) to achieve unity power factor. The second stage is a 300-kHz LLC taking advantage of wide zero voltage switching (ZVS) range and magnetic integration. Thanks to extra control freedom of high dc-link voltage, the dc-dc voltage gain regulation is shared by the dc-ac stage taking advantage of high voltage SiC MOSFETs.

257,"Deploying shared automated electric vehicles (SAEVs) on current roadways in cities will significantly shape current transportation systems and make our urban mobility systems more efficient, convenient, and environmentally friendly. Utilizing wireless power transfer (WPT) technology to charge the SAEVs provides perfect fits for realizing a fully automated mobility system. However, the investment in wireless charging infrastructure (WCI) presents a critical barrier for commercializing and adopting this technology. The barrier can be cleared by realizing the proper design of the WPT system that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the cost of WCI at the same time. This paper introduces a system design optimization tool and methodology for WCI for serving fixed-route SAEVs in automated mobility districts (AMDs). The tool offers the capability of integrating driving data (simulated or collected from the real world), vehicle parameters (e.g., battery, motor, dimensions, and so on), and wireless charger characteristics (rate, locations, alignment, and so on) to generate energy and state-of-charge profiles for each vehicle, considering motoring, regenerative braking, and charging. Furthermore, the proposed tool incorporates a multi-objective optimization layer for searching the optimum design parameters based on predefined objectives and constraints. The proposed method was utilized to design the WCI for a hypothetical AMD scenario with four SAEVs. The outcomes show that implementing in-route wireless chargers at designated stops for the SAEVs with maximum power level has the potential to provide a charge sustaining operation with 52% reduction in the on-board battery and presents the most cost-effective solution. The proposed solution is assessed in comparison with other charging technologies, such as stationary WPT and dc fast charging, and it shows the most feasible option for an AMD network in terms of cost, convenience, and performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734845/,OPEN_ACCESS,8734845,16,0,Journals,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920232,79979,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734845/,8600701,2169-3536,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8734845,2019,6287639,IEEE Access,2019,IEEE,258,79968,System Design and Optimization of In-Route Wireless Charging Infrastructure for Shared Automated Electric Vehicles,7,"[{'affiliation': 'National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595654900', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Ahmed A.

The integrated EV charger is derived from the power inverter, motor windings, sensors, and microchips, which can significantly reduce the system cost and volume. In fact, the charging electromagnetic torque is inevitable to produce, since the alternating currents flow through the motor windings. This is due to the motor windings serving as the filtering inductors of the rectifier for the on-board charger. In order to keep the vehicle standstill during the charging process, a universal expression of charging torque is derived and analyzed, which is according to magnetic co-energy approach. All possible charging torque elimination positions are presented with a numerical method.

However, the efficiency depends on the position of the receiver coil on board the EV relative to the charging pad, which may present a challenge in some coil topologies. In multi-coil topologies, the additional auxiliary coils increase the magnetic coupling between the primary transmitter and receiver coil, helping to improve the misalignment tolerance of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. In this paper, an approach is presented for selecting compensation capacitances in resonance based multi-coil WPT systems that utilize switched capacitor compensation. The approach for selecting the compensation capacitors is based on maintaining operation within the split resonant frequency region while misaligned. In this paper, the compensation capacitor design approach is applied to a four-coil WPT system with overlapping auxiliary coils with switched capacitors on each auxiliary coil. Experimental results are presented which show that with the selected compensation capacitances the power factor is maintained above 0.9 from 0- to 20-cm misalignment compared to a power factor that decreases to 0.34 at 20 cm when the compensation capacitors are not retuned based on misalignment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8758875/,LOCKED,8758875,12,0,Journals,10.1109/TTE.2019.2927803,1014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8758875/,8957650,2372-2088,4.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8758875,Dec. 2019,6687316,IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification,2019,IEEE,261,1004,An Approach for Selecting Compensation Capacitances in Resonance-Based EV Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Switched Capacitors,5,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087240196', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Kimberley A.

263,"This paper presents an accurate analysis and a design methodology for a fixed-frequency-controlled active-clamping half-bridge boost inverter (HBBI)-based series-series compensated inductive power transfer (SS-IPT) charging system. First, the operation principles of the active-clamping HBBI in the charging system are analyzed. Consequently, both the steady-state model and the small-signal model are correctly derived by using the extended describing function (EDF) method and are used to design the system. The derived steady-state model is employed to develop a new design approach to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the inverter. The dynamic behavior of the system is investigated, and a digital controller for charging current regulation is designed based on the derived small-signal model. The proposed methodology enables not only reducing switching losses but also avoiding bifurcation.

264,"An optimized resonant converter with zero-voltage switching over an extensive range of loading is proposed to integrate renewable energy sources to an onboard charger. In conventional resonant circuit, high-frequency transformer (HF) parasitic components are used as tank circuit, this degrades the performance due to non-optimal magnetic components. Here, the HF transformer is fabricated with optimized resonant tank circuit shunt branch inductance ($L_p$) as magnetizing inductance, hence eliminating the need for shunt branch inductance. The proposed resonant converter circuit design is optimized for minimum kilovoltampere rating and better voltage regulation with both duty cycle and frequency control (mixed control method). Furthermore, the performance of the converter at a very light load is improved using the proposed control method. Incorporating a low-$R_{\text{DS}}(\text{ON})$ silicon carbide mosfet and softly turning off the switches for a wide load variation minimizes conduction and switching losses and improves efficiency. Using powder core for the design of the tank circuit reduces magnetic losses. A 3-kW prototype of the converter is built to verify the performance from no load to full load.

Thus, maximizing power transfer efficiency is essential in the system design stage as well as during the operation. In addition, the voltage regulation of EV power bus, supplied by the power transfer system and battery, is needed for a long life of the battery. In this paper, these two requirements are fulfilled under varying EV driving conditions by a single control system applied to a wireless power transfer system. The control system simultaneously tunes the switching frequency of the primary side inverter and the conversion ratio of the secondary side converter to achieve the maximum possible efficiency. In addition, the system adjusts the duty cycle of the primary side inverter to regulate the output voltage. Furthermore, an allowable range for the optimal frequency is determined and imposed to the primary inverter to compensate the power factor reduction according to IEEE std-1547.1. The system needs just one dc/dc converter instead of two as reported in the literature, without any restriction in zero state and start-up conditions.

270,"An integrated power conversion system is proposed for electric vehicles (EVs), which consists of a dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter cascaded by a three-phase four-leg (TPFL) dc-ac converter. The integrated power conversion system can realize both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation and traction operation for EVs. The large capacitor is avoided in the dc link of the proposed power conversion system. Instead, an active snubber with a small film capacitor is connected to the dc link to suppress the voltage oscillation, which is induced by the removal of the large dc-link capacitor. By designing the phase-shifting control for the primary H-bridge of DAB, a high-frequency pulsating dc-link voltage with zero portions is generated. Setting switching actions of the secondary H-bridge of DAB and TPFL during zero portions of the dc link, the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) operation is achieved, and the system efficiency can be improved consequently. Therefore, the fixed-switch-moment control strategies, namely, the finite-set model-predictive-control (FS-MPC) and switch-table direct-torque-control (ST-DTC), are proposed to regulate TPFL for V2G operation mode and traction operation mode, respectively.

The PLL has an area of 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>, and the total area containing two level shifters and gate drivers is 0.21 mm<sup>2</sup>. Two main issues with the PLL-based synchronous rectifier are identified: the locking time and the rms jitter. The designed PLL achieves a sufficient phase noise performance of 8-ns rms jitter, which, from simulations, has been shown to have a minimal impact on the efficiency. The locking time of the PLL is measured to be 8 μs.

272,"A modulation for a single-phase quasi-Z-source-integrated electric vehicle charger (qZSC) system is proposed, which can achieve multiple zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching (ZCS) transitions without any auxiliary circuit. Though the modulation has a couple of hard-switching turn-off transitions, they occur at low current values. The switch of a quasi-Z-source network also can be turned on with ZCS. The inductor currents of the quasi-Z-source network operate in boundary conduction mode or discontinuous conduction mode to achieve all freewheeling diodes turned off naturally.

However, both transportation and power utility sectors retain various challenges in facilitating the seamless integration of battery electric bus (BEB) fleet systems. Among those challenges, the lack of appropriate simulation tools to model, design, and optimize BEB fleet systems is the most salient. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new mathematical formulation to model BEB fleet systems. The model considers the operational requirements of public bus transit systems and the energy consumption characteristics of BEBs. The proposed transit model is then integrated with the power distribution system model to develop an integrated utility-transit problem formulation for the optimal design of BEB systems. The formulated optimization problem aims at determining the optimal configuration parameters of BEB fleet systems that include the bus battery capacity, chargers rated power, and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. The developed utility-transit model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) and is solved using the Basic Open-Source Nonlinear Mixed INteger Programming (BONMIN) optimization solver.

279,"Dual-active-bridge (DAB) circuit is an excellent candidate for a high-efficiency, high-power density, and bidirectional electric vehicle charger. Unlike resonant circuits employing auxiliary inductors and capacitors, DAB minimizes the usage of passive components. The challenge, however, lies in the difficulty of securing zero-voltage switching (ZVS), particularly at light-to-medium load when using the conventional single-phase-shift (SPS) control. This is of utmost importance not only for the sake of the efficiency, but also for minimizing the switch-bridge crosstalk caused by the hard switching-on, thereby enhancing the system reliability. Although dual-phase-shift (DPS) and triple-phase-shift (TPS) can be the answer, they do introduce side effects such as larger switching-off current. This article systematically integrates SPS, DPS, and TPS to maximize full-power ZVS range for both steady state and transient operations in EV chargers. This article plots ZVS boundaries over the full power range, categorizes all operations into nine modes, and proposes a smooth transition method among all operation modes. Dead band is also incorporated in the ZVS boundary setting. Experimental results on a SiC-based charger validate the effectiveness of this method of widening ZVS range for output voltage of 200-450 Vdc and power of 0-20 kW, achieving smooth transitions among various operation modes, and suppressing the switch crosstalk, thereby securing high charger reliability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8911503/,LOCKED,8911503,18,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2019.2955896,7519,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8911503/,9037388,1941-0107,7.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8911503,July 2020,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2020,IEEE,280,7506,Securing Full-Power-Range Zero-Voltage Switching in Both Steady-State and Transient Operations for a Dual-Active-Bridge-Based Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charger,35,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088346289', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Yu Yan', 'id': 37088346289}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085511446', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Hua Bai', 'id': 37085511446}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086191724', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Andrew Foote', 'id': 37086191724}, {'affiliation': 'New Energy Investment Co., Ltd., China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088347293', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Wanbao Wang', 'id': 37088347293}]","['Battery charger', 'dual active bridges (DAB)', 'phase-shift control', 'wide-bandgap device', 'zero-voltage switching (ZVS)']","['Switches', 'Zero voltage switching', 'Batteries', 'Transient analysis', 'Voltage control', 'Capacitors']"

The results indicate that implementing high-power (100 kW) wireless charger at a few designated stops for fixed-route SAESs with the proper track length allows the vehicles to realize charge-sustaining operation, infinite range, and zero recharge downtime, with a significant reduction in the on-board battery (36%) and road coverage (69%), at minimum cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930076/,LOCKED,8930076,8,0,Journals,10.1109/TIA.2019.2958566,1020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930076/,9035957,1939-9367,2.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8930076,March-April 2020,28,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,2020,IEEE,282,1010,"Planning Optimization for Inductively Charged On-Demand Automated Electric Shuttles Project at Greenville, South Carolina",56,"[{'affiliation': 'Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595654900', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Ahmed A.

282,"Efficient dc-dc power-conversion with wide-span voltage-regulation is crucial to a sustainable and robust power electronics system. Dual-active-bridge (DAB) offers straight-forward regulation and its transformer enables voltage step-up/down required for many applications, such as battery chargers and bus converters for dc distribution systems. However, losing soft-switching at light loads or when operating at voltage gains far from the turns ratio severely degrades the efficiency of DAB, especially at high switching frequencies. In this article, we demonstrate an enhanced DAB (E-DAB) topology which employs an adjustable-tap transformer to extend the soft-switching over wider voltage gains and increase the power-transfer capability. By a proper tap adjustment and with single phase-shift modulation, the proposed gallium nitride (GaN)-based converter achieved a peak efficiency of 97.4% with an overall efficiency greater than a conventional DAB for voltage gains of up to 2.8 times higher. Employing a quasi-planar matrix transformer with integrated leakage inductance at 300 kHz allowed for an extremely high power density of 10 kW/l (7.5 kW/l with cooling). The tapped transformer did not incur extra losses to the topology. The gain versus power-transfer characteristic for soft-switching operation was derived for the E-DAB and its improvement in efficiency was experimentally verified over a wide power range.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930089/,LOCKED,8930089,18,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2019.2958632,6677,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8930089/,9037388,1941-0107,7.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8930089,July 2020,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2020,IEEE,283,6673,Enhanced DAB for Efficiency Preservation Using Adjustable-Tap High-Frequency Transformer,35,"[{'affiliation': 'Power and Wide-Band-Gap Electronics Research Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086809218', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Armin Jafari', 'id': 37086809218}, {'affiliation': 'Power and Wide-Band-Gap Electronics Research Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086809891', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Mohammad Samizadeh Nikoo', 'id': 37086809891}, {'affiliation': 'Power and Wide-Band-Gap Electronics Research Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086500205', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Furkan Karakaya', 'id': 37086500205}, {'affiliation': 'Power and Wide-Band-Gap Electronics Research Laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37395740600', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Elison Matioli', 'id': 37395740600}]","['Dual-active-bridge (DAB)', 'efficiency preserva-tion', 'enhanced DAB (E-DAB)', 'high efficiency', 'high frequency', 'high power density', 'gallium nitride (GaN)', 'soft-switching', 'tap-changer', 'variable-tap transformer', 'wide voltage-gain']","['Switches', 'Inductance', 'Bridge circuits', 'Relays', 'Switching frequency', 'Voltage control', 'Density measurement']"

In a WPT charging system the DC/DC converter, which provides an accurate voltage and current to the battery is essential for its safety and lifespan. This paper presents the design and implementation of a high efficiency, light weight-Megahertz WPT system that makes it possible to charge Lithium Batteries by Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) charging with a pair of coils. The proposed WPT charger is simple in structure since it does not require a feedback circuit to implement CC/CV charging. Hence, no communication between the primary side and secondary side is needed. Since the charger can provide automatic mode transfer from CC to CV charging, the battery can be fully charged without the help of an additional DC/DC converter.

The optimal on-time control method is proposed to optimally adjust the on time required to energize the inductor, thus increasing the peak output power to cover a wide distance range. In addition, the hybrid zero-current-switching (ZCS) method is proposed to adaptively calibrate the offset of the ZCS comparator, thus improving the power conversion efficiency.

Recently, with the emergence of high power-density batteries, e.g., supercapacitors, several chargers are typically connected in parallel to provide the required charging power in many applications. However, the classical decentralized control scheme for the multicharger system leads to the current imbalance, which deteriorates the reliability of the charging system. In this article, we extend the CC-CV charging protocol to multicharger systems using a cooperative control method, which can alleviate the current imbalance among chargers effectively. First, the motivation and charging system modeling of this work are provided. Then, a cooperative CC charging protocol and a cooperative CV charging protocol are presented, respectively, and a switching logic is designed to achieve the switching between them based on the supercapacitor voltage.

In this paper, the topologies of on-board integrated electric vehicles (EVs) chargers are reviewed. The topologies of on-board integrated chargers can be classified into three groups based on the integrated components. The first type is that only converter is integrated as one part of the on-board charger. While the grid side also needs filter inductors. The second group is based on the switched reluctance motor, which can integrate both the converter and the motor windings into the on-board charger. This is followed by the integrated charger based on permanent magnet motor (PM) and induction motor (IM). The last group also integrates both the converter and the motor windings. Then this paper gives a new single-phase on-board integrated charger based on AC motor. Parts of inverter are used as single-phase rectifier, parts of inverter coupled with one capacitor and inductor reconstruct an active power filter (APF) circuit, and the motor windings are used as grid-side filter inductors. As the existence of APF circuit, the proposed integrated charger can eliminate the second harmonic ripple and the quasi-Z-source network just need small capacitor and inductor to suppress ripples.

Major challenges to the adoption of WPT systems include coil misalignment and large air-gap WPT, both of which degrade the transfer efficiency. To address these issues, this article presents a compact WPT charger for the rear of an EV, capable of correcting lateral misalignment Δx using two integrated electromagnetic coils. The air-gap Δy is reduced due to the rear placement of the charging pads. The variation in Δy, however, increases due to vehicle parking accuracy, which impacts the operation of the electromagnetic coils. This article proposes a closed-loop three-stage position-correcting control algorithm capable of detecting the impedance and resonant frequency of the system, which, in conjunction with the electromagnetic coils, results in improved vehicle alignment. The experimental prototype achieves a peak dc-dc efficiency of 90.1% at 5 kW WPT. With Δy = 50 mm, the electromagnetic coils laterally align the pads within 1.75 s and correct Δx as large as 240 mm.

Much like SiC is paralleled with Si, and GaN could be paralleled with Si to resolve these challenges. In this article, gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are paralleled to various Si MOSFETs. Two different triggering approaches are considered: one adds a time delay between gate signals and the other uses a pulse triggering technique. Both methods ensure that the GaN endures the switching loss, while the Si switches conduct the majority of the current, thereby maximizing the advantages of both types of switches. To follow is a comprehensive study of the critical transient processes, such as the gate cross talking between Si and GaN, current commutation in the dead band, voltage spikes during the turn-off caused by parasitics, the thermal performance, and the cost analysis.

290,"This article proposes a hybrid LLC resonant converter with three modes of operation for on-board chargers of electric vehicles. The converter can operate as a full-bridge converter, dual-phase half-bridge LLC converter, or single-phase half-bridge LLC converter to improve efficiency at low-voltage and light-load conditions. Without using additional switches, the operation mode of the proposed converter is switched by different modulation schemes. Moreover, the resonant inductance for LLC operation can be reduced so as to be integrated into the transformers, resulting in an increase in the power density. During the operation of three modes, all the primary switches achieve zero-voltage switching, thus minimizing the switching losses.

By maintaining a constant output power rather than providing a constant output current throughout the dominant stage of battery charging, the IPT converter can make the utmost of its power capability, thus having a faster charging rate. The proposed single-stage IPT converter adopts series-series compensation and includes a switch-controlled capacitor (SCC) and a semiactive rectifier (SAR) in the secondary side. Manipulating the SCC and the SAR to emulate the optimum impedance of the resonator and the load, we propose a novel operation approach combining the merits of load-independent transfer characteristic and load impedance matching, to achieve a simple solution to CP charging and maximum efficiency throughout the charging process. Since the control scheme is based on fixed operating frequency and secondary-side real-time regulation, wireless feedback communication is not required. Moreover, soft switching and low voltage stress can be easily achieved in this IPT converter.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8974434/,LOCKED,8974434,18,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2020.2969685,8984,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8974434/,9088165,1941-0107,9.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8974434,Sept. 2020,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2020,IEEE,292,8973,A Single-Stage Inductive-Power-Transfer Converter for Constant-Power and Maximum-Efficiency Battery Charging,35,"[{'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Macao, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085491933', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Zhicong Huang', 'id': 37085491933}, {'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, the Institute of Microelectronics, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37415720700', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Chi-Seng Lam', 'id': 37415720700}, {'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, the Institute of Microelectronics, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37270203500', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Pui-In Mak', 'id': 37270203500}, {'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI the Institute of Microelectronics', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37272711500', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Rui Paulo da Silva Martins', 'id': 37272711500}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276109900', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Siu-Chung Wong', 'id': 37276109900}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276105700', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Chi K.

292,"The wireless power transfer (WPT) system has been extensively studied for its safety, convenience, and esthetics and has gradually been introduced into our life applications. In order to maintain battery performance, constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage (CV) charging outputs are generally regarded as the dominant charging modes. However, battery equivalent resistance changes significantly during the charging, so it is difficult to simultaneously achieve load-independent CC and CV charging outputs and zero phase angle (ZPA) condition. This article proposes a new LCCC/S topology and its corresponding parameter tuning method to obtain CC and CV charging modes at two different ZPA operating frequency points, respectively. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the receiver has only one compensation capacitor, which follows the principle that the receiver of the WPT system should remain compact and portable. Furthermore, a simple frequency modulation controller is designed to solve the problem of inaccuracies of the charging outputs due to parasitic losses of components and fluctuations of dc input voltage. Finally, a verification setup with 3-A output current in the CC mode and 48-V output voltage in the CV mode was built to validate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed LCCC/S-compensated WPT system and the corresponding control method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8981993/,LOCKED,8981993,10,0,Journals,10.1109/JESTPE.2020.2971583,1180,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8981993/,9330810,2168-6785,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8981993,Feb. 2021,6245517,IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics,2021,IEEE,293,1169,Analysis and Design of an LCCC/S-Compensated WPT System With Constant Output Characteristics for Battery Charging Applications,9,"[{'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086882235', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Lin Yang', 'id': 37086882235}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37406909200', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Xiaoming Li', 'id': 37406909200}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37280143900', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Sheng Liu', 'id': 37280143900}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086883286', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Ziwei Xu', 'id': 37086883286}, {'affiliation': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086364519', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Changsong Cai', 'id': 37086364519}]","['Constant current (CC)', 'constant voltage (CV)', 'LCCC/S topology', 'wireless power transfer (WPT)', 'zero phase angle (ZPA)']","['Topology', 'Batteries', 'Receivers', 'Coils', 'Power electronics', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Tuning']"

Integrating charging facilities, especially high-power chargers in fast charging stations, into power distribution systems remarkably alters the traditional load flow pattern, and thus imposes great challenges on the operation of distribution network in which controllable resources are rare. On the other hand, provided with appropriate incentives, the energy storage capability of electric vehicle offers a unique opportunity to facilitate the integration of distributed wind and solar power generation into power distribution system. The above trends call for thorough investigation and research on the interdependence between transportation system and power distribution system. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on this line of research.

From the view of impedance, it's good for the cascaded system stability to reduce output impedance of battery converter when the converter is the first stage. Another, increasing the converter's input impedance could improve the cascade system stability when the converter becomes the rear one.

The stator windings of three-phase induction motor (IM) can be used as a grid interfacing inductor with the constraint that the rotor should be in the stationary position during the charging mode. This article proposes the stator winding configurations of three-phase IM split into two equal parts at zero electrical degree for the on-board integrated battery charger. The effective filtering with these two three-phase windings combination, either in series or parallel while the rotor is in a stationary position, is analyzed. The equivalent inductance provided by the stator windings for filtering is increased by generating the pulsating magnetic field (PMF) in the motor. However, it results in the unbalanced impedances in filter causing odd harmonics in the grid current. This is resolved by using a modified double synchronous reference frame control algorithm, which maintains the balanced current operation with the unity power factor at the grid interface during the charging mode. This configuration is obtained by using the existing three-phase-based drive-train components, thereby providing the saving in space and reducing the weight of EV.

The proposed converter serves the purpose of a battery charger as well as a 3-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) to drive the traction motor. The 3-phase VSI is the backbone of this converter that can be either reconfigured to a propulsion unit or to a battery charger by adding few more power electronics components. During charging mode, the topology is reconfigured to form a front-end boost power factor correction rectifier which is cascaded by a DC-DC converter through a DC link. The same power stage is reconfigured to operate as a 3-phase VSI to drive the traction motor during propulsion mode. Thus, it reduces the switch count by eliminating the requirement of a separate inverter stage. Simultaneously the weight, volume, and cost of the overall system are reduced. Unified control technique is implemented which is capable to achieve near-unity power factor operation of front-end boost rectifier as well as optimal battery charging without sensing the DC link voltage. This control scheme implements a single control loop for both stages by eliminating the need of two separate control loop for each stage of the charger.

300,"Inductive power transfer (IPT) technologies have gained a wide acceptance in onboard battery charging applications due to some significant advantages over traditional plug-in systems. An IPT battery charger is expected to provide a configurable charging profile consisting of an initial constant current (CC) and a subsequent constant voltage (CV) efficiently. With a wide load range during the charging process, two sets of IPT topologies with the inherent load-independent CC and CV at the same zero-phase angle (ZPA) frequency are commonly combined into a hybrid topology to avoid sophisticated control schemes, while maintaining nearly unity power factor and soft switching of power switches simultaneously. However, the load-independent CC and CV are usually constrained by parameters of a loosely coupled transformer (LCT), making the LCT hard to design. To solve it, this paper systematically presents a method to derive such effective hybrid IPT converters, which starts from some existing topologies having the configurable CC or CV output and cascades a general T network for mode transition.

The PEV charger is controlled by a unified controller that incorporates direct power and current MPC to dynamically control decoupled active-reactive power flow in a smart grid environment as well as to control PEV battery charging and discharging reliably. PV power generation with maximum power tracking is seamlessly integrated with the power flow control to provide additional power generation. Fast dynamic response and good steady-state performance under all power flow modes and various environmental conditions are evaluated and analyzed. From the results obtained, the charger demonstrates less than 1.5% total harmonic distortion as well as low active and reactive power ripple of less than 7% and 8% respectively on the grid for all power flow modes. The PEV battery also experiences a low charging and discharging current ripple of less than 2.5%.

302,"This article studies the rotational movement and charging torque in a new reconfigured on-board charger during the charging process. Recently, the reconfigured on-board charger becomes attractive because the propulsive units are engaged in the charging system to reduce the cost and volume. Since the unbalanced currents flow through the three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine, the rotational movement and charging torque are generated. The charging torque may be equal to the rated propulsive torque at some special rotor positions, which is unsafe and may lead to the rotational movement, extra noise, and motor wear. In order to reduce the influence of charging torque and rotational movement during the charging process, the charging torque is analyzed based on the magnetic coenergy. It is found that the charging torque is related to the unbalanced current, differential-mode current, and current ripple in motor windings. Thus, the mutual inductances of motor windings during the charging process are decoupled into the differential-mode and common-mode inductances. Furthermore, a solution is provided to significantly minimize the charging torque based on the control methods of the ac/dc side and dc/dc side.

A boost active bridge (BAB) converter presented in previous work was shown as a suitable solution; however, this system utilized two additional dc inductors. As such, this article presents a BAB converter, which integrates the current splitting functionality previously achieved using two dc inductors into a Double D magnetic coupler. This achieves a reduction in the magnetic volume of approximately 70%. Analysis of the proposed converter together with detailed design guidelines to maximize power transfer efficiency for a system designed to meet the SAEJ2954 specifications is also presented. Experimentally obtained efficiencies from a 7-kW prototype system showed minimal variation over the full range of loading conditions, ranging between 94.2% and 92%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056565/,LOCKED,9056565,2,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2020.2984784,12727,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056565/,9158598,1941-0107,12.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9056565,Dec. 2020,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2020,IEEE,311,12716,An Integrated Boost Active Bridge Based Secondary Inductive Power Transfer Converter,35,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086309023', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Gaurav R.

The charger is enabled to operate autonomously using a PV array for providing an uninterruptible charging and power to household loads. However, in the absence of the PV array or insufficient PV array generation, the grid-connected mode of operation is presented. Moreover, the charger is supported with the synchronization and seamless mode switching control, so that the charger automatically connects/disconnects from the grid without disturbing the EV charging and household supply. The charger is also enabled with the vehicle-to-grid active/reactive power support to the grid and vehicle-to-home power transfer for supporting the local loads in an islanded condition. The charger is also controlled to operate as an active power filter for achieving the unity power factor operation and total harmonic distortion of the grid current within 5%. Moreover, for achieving energy management, a dc-link voltage regulation based energy management strategy is used and a sliding mode control is used for regulating the dc-link voltage. For satisfactory operation under distorted voltage condition, a second-order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop with dc offset rejection is used to generate the sinusoidal reference grid current.

315,"Integrated on-board battery chargers (OBCs) have been recently introduced as an optimal/elegant solution to increase electric vehicle (EV) market penetration as well as minimize overall EV cost. Unlike conventional off-board and on-board battery chargers, integrated OBCs exploit the existing propulsion equipment for battery charging without extra bulky components and/or dedicated infrastructure. OBCs are broadly categorized into three-phase and single-phase types with unidirectional or bidirectional power flow. This paper starts with surveying the main topologies introduced in the recent literature employing either induction or permanent magnet motors to realize fully integrated slow (single-phase) and fast (three-phase) on-board EV battery charging systems, with emphasis on topologies that entail no or minimum hardware reconfiguration. Although, permanent magnet (PM) motors with conventional double-layer distributed winding layouts have been deployed in most commercial EV motors, the non-overlapped fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) has been the prevailing choice in the most recent permanent magnet motor designs due to its outstanding operational merits. Hence, a thorough investigation of the impact different FSCW stator winding designs have on machine performance under the charging process is presented in this paper. To this end, the induced magnet losses, which represent a challenging demerit of the FSCW, have been used to compare different topologies under both propulsion and charging operation modes. Based on the introduced comparative study, the optimal slot/pole combinations that correspond to the best compromise under both operational modes have been highlighted.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9088125/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

Realizing a low-cost and low-complexity onboard impedance measuring system is a vital issue for the management based on the ac impedance. In the article, a novel impedance measuring system combined with a high-power dual active bridge (DAB) converter and distributed sampling units is proposed and verified. The DAB converter is designed to generate the ac disturbance to ensure a quasi-steady measurement of the battery impedance. The distributed signal sampling units simultaneously measure the voltage and current of all the series-connected battery cells in a module to measure their impedance. The measured impedance in a frequency range of 0.1-500 Hz shows the feasibility of the system. The root-mean-square errors of the measured impedance phase from 0.2 to 200 Hz and the magnitude from 0.1 to 500 Hz are less than 6.9% and 4.0%, respectively.

323,"The full-bridge commonly employed in the primary of an SAE J2954 compliant inductive power transfer (IPT) based wireless electric vehicle (EV) charger possesses many challenges. To alleviate these issues, expensive switches, and extra components are employed together with secondary-side regulation. As an alternative, this article proposes a new topology, termed integrated boost multilevel converter (IBMC). An IBMC consists of series-connected half-bridge submodules (SMs) in each arm, and the dc supply is connected to each arm through a dc inductor. When an IBMC is used as the primary converter, its ability to generate a boosted multilevel output voltage, enables it to regulate the power flow efficiently over a wide load/coupling range without requiring a secondary-side regulator. This article focuses on the operating principles of this new IBMC under steady-state conditions and discusses a modulation scheme that can be used to regulate the power flow while balancing the SM voltages. The benefits of the IBMC is experimentally validated using an SAE J2954 WPT2/Z2 compliant prototype. This prototype used an IBMC built with low-cost switching devices on the primary-side to regulate the power flow to 7.7 kW as the coupling factor changed between 0.11 and 0.25 while maintaining the system efficiency between 90.4% and 91.9%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121233/,LOCKED,9121233,3,0,Journals,10.1109/JESTIE.2020.3003357,45,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121233/,9162174,2687-9743,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9121233,July 2020,8847244,IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Industrial Electronics,2020,IEEE,324,36,A Novel Converter Topology for a Primary-Side Controlled Wireless EV Charger With a Wide Operation Range,1,"[{'affiliation': 'Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086538098', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Wenwei Victor Wang', 'id': 37086538098}, {'affiliation': 'Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37297688600', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Duleepa J.

However, a wide range of battery voltage levels and fast response to power conversion between forward and backward operations are still challenging aspects of the aging test power system. In this article, an improved ac/dc converter is proposed for the aging test application in electric vehicles.

The first stage is a single-phase ac/dc rectifier, which realizes unity input power factor and power transmission between the ac grid and dc bus. The second stage is the LLC-dc/dc transformer (LLC-DCX) which provides electrical isolation and fixed voltage transfer ratio.

329,"For so many years, silicon (Si) IGBTs have been widely utilized in power converters for low-to-medium voltage high-power applications. However, the ever-increasing requirements to improve power density, power quality, and efficiency of power converters have urged researchers to explore alternative technologies such as silicon-carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. SiC devices fill the mentioned gaps with increased voltage blocking capability, higher switching speed, and lower on-state resistance; yet, their price is much more elevated. Both technologies are adopted in matrix rectifiers (MRs), which have recently gained attention for on-board electric vehicle (EV) charger and battery energy storage system (BESS) applications because of their controllable bidirectional power flow and compact size. A MR contains bidirectional switches made up of two power devices, doubling the device count and cost to conventional voltage source converters (VSCs). In this paper, we compare in terms of efficiency four types of MRs, each one consisting of a specific bidirectional switch configuration. Among these switches, we propose a cost-effective hybrid configuration consisting of Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs for straightforward commutations during the charging mode of matrix rectifiers. Also, the proposed configuration is compared to other typical bidirectional switch configurations. To perform these comparisons, the switching energy losses in 1200 V commercial IGBTs and MOSFETs, constituting the bidirectional switches, are measured through the double-pulse test (DPT). Performance comparisons of the MRs are supported through a simulator and verified via experimental work, where the proposed arrangement results in a cost-effective solution in MRs operating with switching frequencies up to 50 kHz and further.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146527/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

331,"This article presents a high-conversion-ratio (HCR), high-voltage-tolerant (HVT) energy-harvesting battery charger using 0.18-μm standard CMOS for Internet of Things (IoT). To reduce conversion ratio (CR) of inductive power converter and optimize overall power efficiency, the proposed charger cascades a boost converter and reconfigurable charge pump. Different from the high-voltage device, the standard CMOS process has lower parasitic capacitance and on-resistance; therefore, it can reduce switching and conduction loss. The reconfigurable charge pump dynamically changes the number of pumping stages according to the output voltage (V<sub>OUT</sub>) by automatic configuration selector (ACS). To manage the limited power from a thermoelectric generator (TEG), the converter works under the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The zero-current detector (ZCD) employs an analog comparator with digital offset compensator and digital comparator to control off-time (T<sub>OFF</sub>) quickly and accurately. The self-idle constant on-time (SI-COT) and idle mode both control the mechanism, helping to further reduce static power dissipation. As a result, the proposed converter can achieve peak efficiency of up to 76% at a 92× conversion ratio with output power ranging from 10 μW to 1.9 mW. The available input voltage ranges are 40 to 400 mV, and the dual output voltage ranges are 1 to 1.6 V and 2 to 4.6 V for V<sub>BOOST</sub> and V<sub>OUT</sub>, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9158491/,LOCKED,9158491,1,0,Journals,10.1109/TCSI.2020.3012599,4121,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9158491/,9240118,1558-0806,11.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9158491,Nov. 2020,8919,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,2020,IEEE,332,4110,A 115× Conversion-Ratio Thermoelectric Energy-Harvesting Battery Charger for the Internet of Things,67,"[{'affiliation': 'Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085761283', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Ming-Jie Chung', 'id': 37085761283}, {'affiliation': 'Division of Electrical, Electronic and Infocommunications Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267176000', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Tetsuya Hirose', 'id': 37267176000}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37290735400', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Takahito Ono', 'id': 37290735400}, {'affiliation': 'Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085344773', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Po-Hung Chen', 'id': 37085344773}]","['High-conversion-ratio (HCR)', 'high voltage tolerant (HVT)', 'DC–DC converter', 'thermoelectric energy harvesting', 'reconfigurable charge pump']","['Batteries', 'Voltage control', 'Internet of Things', 'Standards', 'Mathematical model', 'Inductors', 'CMOS process']"
332,"The development of wireless charging technology has made research in rechargeable wireless sensing networks (WRSNs) a hot topic. Charge scheduling, which involves allocating mobile charger(s) to replenish energy to the sensors of a network so that the network can remain active for a longer time, is one of the most essential issues in this field. Most previous works addressed the charge-scheduling problem by using proactive or on-demand methods, each with its own advantages and issues. In this work, we propose a novel bottleneck prediction and removal mechanism (BP&amp;R) that seamlessly integrates the two completely different scheduling strategies. The BP&amp;R predicts proactively the potential charging needs that may overwhelm the on-demanding scheduling and eliminate those incidents beforehand. This allows the on-demand scheduling, which usually relies on time and/or distance factors in determining charging order, to concentrate on tackling the problem considering only the distance factor. A simple distance-based near job first (NJF) algorithm is thus sufficient for charge scheduling when time-related factors are considered prior to the determination of the charging order. Use of NJF algorithm also allow us derive a shorter path length in charge scheduling, which results in a tighter charging threshold. A lower charging threshold corresponds to fewer charging requests and less pressure on charge scheduling. In general, the new scheduling strategy relies on the on-demand feature to gather the charging demands of the network, while proactively includes additional sensor nodes that could potentially cause subsequent issues in the scheduling plan. The on-demand and proactive natures of the proposed strategy ensure that it can adapt to the dynamic charging needs of sensors, while at the same time taking precautionary measures to avoid possible burst requests in the future. Extensive simulations show that the proposed strategy can achieve a better network lifetime than other state-of-art scheduling methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9164945/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

334,"A segmented three-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) can bring a significant advantage in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) since it can be used as a simple inductor filter for an integrated battery charger without torque production during charging/vehicle-to-gird (V2G) mode. However, unlike an induction machine, majority of IPMSMs have low value of stator inductance, possibly below the minimum limit of the pulsewidth modulation rectifier requirement; therefore, the integrated battery chargers based on these types of IPMSMs may have difficulty dealing with grid current harmonics during charging/V2G mode. This article presents the method to design a suitable segmented three-phase IPMSM with nine windings (S3-IPMSM-9W) for integrated battery chargers. The optimization of stator winding inductance is proposed in order to get a large stator inductance capable of achieving acceptable ripple during charging and does not degrade the traction mode performance. Therefore, an optimized inductance, which is eight times greater than the nonoptimized stator inductance value was obtained. 96% of the efficiency of the optimized machine was achieved during the motoring mode. Moreover, with the help of optimized leakage inductance acting as a grid-side filter, the total harmonic distortion below 5% is reached during charging.

337,"This article proposes a simple and effective method to reduce the bulky capacitor in onboard battery charger (OBC) where low-voltage (LV) battery charging circuit is utilized as an active power decoupling (APD) circuit to filter out the second-order ripple power. When the OBC is connected to the grid to charge the high-voltage (HV) battery, the switches on the primary side of the LV charging circuit are operated as those of an ac-dc converter with APD function. Consequently, small dc-link capacitors can be used instead of large capacitor banks. In the proposed OBC, the switching devices are shared for the ac-dc converter, APD circuit, and primary-side of the LV charger. For a simultaneous charging of the LV and HV batteries, a dc-dc converter is added, which shares the same transformer core and secondary side with the LV charging circuit. So the functions of the OBC are maintained in the proposed topology whereas the volume and cost are decreased by 52.3% and 46.9% compared with the conventional nonisolated OBC, respectively. A 2-kW SiC-based prototype has been designed and tested to verify the validity of the proposed system.

344,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining more and more user acceptances due to their clean, efficient, and environmentally friendly nature. Currently, most commercial EVs use conductive charging for their batteries. Inductive charging, which is an alternative charging technology, has recently received a great deal of attention because of its increased user convenience and safety. It is forecast that the two charging technologies will be implemented in future charging infrastructures globally. Consequently, future EVs need to be capable of dealing with both charging methods. So far, there have only been a very few charging topologies reported in the literature that describe both charging methods in the same vehicle. However, solutions that have been proposed do not show a significant component reduction. In this article, we propose a hybrid charger system where the high-frequency transformer of an onboard dc-dc converter becomes the coupling point between the conductive and inductive charging. Using this coupling point, the circuit utilizes the same components for conductive and for inductive charging. This results in the reduction of component count and, therefore, an improved integration. The proposed system is verified by both simulation and experiment.

Effort is made towards providing software as well as hardware design-level protection mechanisms to mitigate the malicious effects of such cyberattacks on the OBC hardware. This system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the fault occurrences under various data integrity attacks as well as to validate the effectiveness of our proposed countermeasure approaches. Quantitative analyses of the obtained results clearly demonstrate that if adequate precautionary measures are properly taken while designing the charging architecture (e.g., implementing intelligence to the main controller), any electrical hazard or deterioration of health of the components can be avoided to the maximum extent under the circumstances of a malicious cyberattack.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9296573/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

346,"This paper presents a dynamic thermal model which predicts the winding temperature of electrical machines at steady-state and transient conditions where windings are used in integrated battery chargers (IBCs) for DC charging in a stationary position. Using winding in high current charging process causes rising winding temperature which affects insulation life. Switched reluctance machines are a proper choice for using in electric vehicles (EVs) because of their advantages such as simple and sturdy structures. IBCs can reduce volume and weight of EVs and total cost is diminished because of integration. The analytical thermal model proposed in this paper can calculates the winding temperature in balanced and unbalanced currents injection because of the phase inductance in each rotor angle is distinct, so current excitation in each phase should be different for obtaining zero total torque and keeping rotor in a stationary position, also a reduced-order model is proposed with minor impact on the accuracy of the model. Special attention has been paid to monitor the winding temperature with considering the motor lifetime in DC charging mode, this view has not been addressed in IBCs before.

The proposed control scheme matches the reflected load impedance, by controlling accordingly the front-end dc-dc converter (FEC) of the SS-WPT system. The proposed control scheme drives the FEC, through an optimizer which takes into account the misalignment but also the operational conditions of the system to achieve high efficiency throughout the entire charging process - regardless the EV type, the misalignment conditions or the on-board charger. The novelty of the proposed optimizer lies upon its universal characteristic, which makes it compatible to various SS-WPT topologies. As such, the proposed charging concept is a universal solution, which optimizes the system efficiency regardless the receiver side on-board charger topology (single-stage or double-stage), technical characteristics or control scheme that implements the charging profile. Finally, for the necessary communication between the transmitter and the receiver sides, the Internet of Things (IoT) is employed, offering a low-cost and flexible solution that overcomes compatibility problems between wireless antennas.

351,"The battery charging technology is a rapidly developing area in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. The nonavailability of charging stations, longer battery charging times, and range-anxiety are main concerns for EV users. A fast, light, and efficient on-board charger is the need of the hour. Integrated battery chargers (IBC) are a viable solution since it uses the driving circuit (motor and inverter) already present in the EV for charging the battery. IBC using split-phase machine and three-legged inverter is an interesting topology. It has the advantage of using the existing three-phase machine and three-legged inverter. Also, this topology generates zero instantaneous torque while charging the battery. Due to motor winding reconfiguration during charging, even when the grid supply is balanced, the grid currents were found to be highly unbalanced. In this article, a mathematical model of the IBC using a split-phase machine in stationary and rotating reference frame is developed and presented for the first time. Mathematical proof for zero instantaneous torque production while charging the battery is presented. The effects of mutual inductance, L<sub>dq</sub> along with L<sub>d</sub> and L<sub>q</sub>, are presented in the rotating reference frame model of the IBC. This is found to make the system unbalanced, and the grid currents represented the in rotating reference frame are found to contain second harmonic components along with the expected dc terms. Using the mathematical model, new feedforward terms have been developed, and used in the control loop with proportional integral controller (PI) and proportional resonant controllers to mitigate grid current harmonics.

352,"This article presents a single-phase, single-stage onboard plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger. The single-phase PEV chargers have an inherent problem of introducing a second-order ripple component on dc side. This problem is further exaggerated during the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode of operation where it may be normally controlled to supply both active as well as reactive power. During the V2G reactive power compensation, the second-order harmonics ripple component at dc side will increase, which further reduces the life cycle and performance of battery pack. Therefore, a second-order ripple component compensation technique is proposed by precompensating the reference current itself. The resultant reference current is periodic in nature, and accordingly, a repetitive controller (RC) is used, which is well known for its capability of tracking the periodic signals. The PEV charger is controlled in both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G modes. In this article, the performance of the controller has been tested in eight different modes on active-reactive (P-Q) power plane and found that ripple minimization technique successfully reduced second-order ripple component on dc side.

Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid.

In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q-table is updated for guiding the route of UAV.

365,"In this paper Brayton-Moser passivity-based control (BM-PBC) methodology is developed for an on-board battery charger for plug-in electric vehicles(PHEVs). The main features of this electric vehicle (EV) charger include improved power quality, reduced filter size and voltage stress across the switches and fast dynamic response. In this paper, a dynamic model of the three-level (TL) boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is developed using the Brayton-Moser formulation. Then, the Brayton-Moser based control technique is designed by injecting a virtual resistor in series with the input inductor. Further, the stability analysis of the proposed controller is also carried out using energy balance approach. To improve the dynamic performance and reduce the steady state error, a PI controller is integrated with the aforesaid controller. Therefore, the controller comprises of BM-PBC and the PI controller is implemented for the TL boost PFC converter as a battery charger and its performances are investigated under various operating modes with the help of MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, power quality of charger is assessed by monitoring source current total harmonic distortion (THD) under different operating conditions. It is also observed that the proposed system provides THD less than 5% in source current which satisfies IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard. The performance of the aforesaid controller is also compared with the conventional PI controller.

Using the proposed modulation scheme, an IBMC can generate a boosted square-wave-shaped ac voltage with a controllable amplitude, enabling it to regulate the power efficiently over a wide load and/or coupling range while achieving zero voltage switching for all switches. This article focuses on the steady-state operating principles of the proposed digitized modulation scheme. Key practical considerations, such as capacitor voltage balancing and semiconductor device selection, are highlighted. To verify the benefits of the proposed modulation scheme, an SAE J2954 WPT2/Z2 compliant wireless EV charger prototype that uses an IBMC as the primary converter is designed and built. 200 V Si MOSFETs are employed in the 12 submodules (SMs) that compose the IBMC.

367,"This paper investigates the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) characteristics of an on-board multiplexing converter that utilizes paralleled silicon carbide (SiC) devices to achieve high efficiency and high-power density for the application in electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The multiplexing converter can operate as a three-phase interleaved DC/DC converter with a peak output power of 60 kW or an integrated two-stage non-isolated on-board charger (OBC) with an output power of 6.6 kW. The novelty of this paper is that it reveals that in the DC/DC mode the series resonance between the input negative lead parasitic inductance and the high frequency transmission line effects of the input power inductor will increase the conducted EMI levels, which can be mitigated by optimizing the winding methods of the power inductor or by adding a small capacitor, and reveals that in the non-isolated OBC mode the shielded cable on the battery-side will increase the grid-side EMI in the low frequency ranges, which can be suppressed by integrated installation of EMI filters without affecting the system power density. Firstly, parasitic parameters of the components of the multiplexing converter, such as the power inductors, the SiC MOSFETs and the shielded cables, are extracted and validated with impedance measurements, and the corresponding equivalent circuit models are established. Then, the conducted EMI simulation models of the multiplexing converter in different working modes are established. The influence of different interference sources and different parasitic parameters on the system EMI characteristics are analyzed, and the effective EMI suppression measures are given without affecting the system power density. Finally, the conducted EMI characteristics of the multiplexing converter and the effectiveness of the proposed EMI suppression measures are tested and verified through experiments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402868/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.

370,"For ac/dc power conversion applications like server power supply, telecom power supply, and on-board charger of an electric vehicle, the rising electricity demand has presented challenges toward high efficiency and high power density. The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) based multilevel power factor correction (PFC) converter has much higher power density than that of traditional boost PFC converter. However, the CHB-PFC converter has multiple floating dc outputs, which leads to a common mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue due to the parasitic capacitance of cascaded dc/dc stages and layouts and distributed noise sources existing in the ac/dc system. Thus, a large EMI filter is necessary for the PFC system that sharply degrades the system's power density. In order to quantify the CM noise caused by the floating outputs and cascaded parasitic capacitance, a unified equivalent CM circuit model is derived in this article, which decouples the effects among the multiple CM noise sources in the CHB converter. Based on the derived circuit model, a mirror-bridge phase-shift modulation is proposed to cancel the CM noise within the CHB converter itself. A single-phase 2-kW CHB PFC prototype has been built up to verify the analysis, and 40-dB CM noise reduction compared with conventional unipolar modulation is achieved by the proposed modulation scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9442906/,LOCKED,9442906,1,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2021.3084523,13725,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9442906/,9519819,1941-0107,12.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9442906,Dec. 2021,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2021,IEEE,371,13716,Mirror-Bridge Phase-Shift Modulation With Low Common-Mode Noise for Single-Phase CHB PFC,36,"[{'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088430085', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Yu Qi', 'id': 37088430085}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281236600', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Xinke Wu', 'id': 37281236600}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088644090', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Faheem Muhammad', 'id': 37088644090}]","['Cascaded H-bridge (CHB)', 'common mode (CM)', 'modulation']","['Power system measurements', 'Equivalent circuits', 'Density measurement', 'Inductors', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Electromagnetic interference', 'Capacitors']"

Using more plates, it can effectively use the coupling space to maintain the required self- and mutual capacitance, while minimize the cross coupling effects. Meanwhile, the new coupler is also helpful to reduce the radioactive electric field, and the high-radiation region is reduced dramatically.

373,"This paper proposes an improved fast charging strategy for electric vehicles (EVs) by considering available battery capacity. According to previous research and battery experiment reports, the energy capacity of batteries is not fixed, and it can decrease temporarily depending on the magnitude of charging or discharging power. This paper addresses the decreased capacity in proportion to the magnitude of the charging power which leads to a reduction in the driving range. For effective and practical use for EV users, the change in battery capacity is expressed through an equation, and a new state of charged indicator is proposed. To improve the conventional charging method that uniformly supplies power regardless of the battery capacity, this paper proposes an optimal charging strategy injecting constant power. The proposed charging strategy provides an optimal charging power reference to minimize costs considering charged energy, charging time, and usable energy loss based on billing system of EV charging. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed charging method, the optimal charging power reference for each battery is calculated based on capacity and characteristics, and the total cost is compared.

This paper gives a unique empirical insight into the long-term effects on batteries performing an energy demanding V2G service. To this end, an extensive method for measuring the battery capacity of series produced electric vehicles (EVs) via the DC charge port was developed. The reproducibility of the method is demonstrated with repeated tests on new and aged vehicles and the results are compared with the EVs internal estimates, read via the on-board diagnostics port. The method is also validated with a state-of-the-art battery degradation model. The capacity test method is used to evaluate the battery degradation of a fleet of commercially owned EVs which, as a part of the world's first commercial operation, have been used for V2G services for five years. The EVs have, together with ±10 kW V2G chargers, been delivering primary frequency regulation for 15 hours per day with a daily energy throughput of 50.6 kWh.

378,"The resonant dc–dc converter is preferred for high-efficiency applications due to its less switching loss and better electromagnetic interference (EMI) characteristics. However, in a wide range of steady-state voltage gain applications, such as the on-board charger application, the wide output voltage range will lead to a bulky resonant inductor, which will decrease the power density. Magnetic integration of the inductor and transformer is an effective way to reduce the total magnetic volume. However, the traditional integrated magnetics of transformer and inductor will result in high magnetic field intensity in the external space nearby the integrated magnetic component. This external magnetic field will cause large eddy current losses in the neighboring metal heatsink and serious EMI issues. In order to deal with this problem, an integrated winding structure with a negligible external magnetic field is proposed in this article. By rebuilding the external winding segments with a better coupling coefficient, the external magnetic field intensity is canceled without efficiency and size sacrifices.

380,"Although there is a growing interest in developing fast charging methods to enhance the Electric Vehicles' appeal, the main energy supply is still the single-phase outlet. While single-phase charging may be simpler than three-phase, there are challenges in the integration of the propulsion and charging systems without adding inductive grid filters. Such integration would bring benefits like the simplification and reduction of components, costs, volume or weight. This can be achieved by using the windings of the propulsion machine as grid filters, but the use of the electric motor as a grid inductive filter leads to the generation of pulsating torque during the charging state. This translates into vibration, noise and eventually, damage to the motor and other components of the system. In this work, the authors propose a control strategy that considerably reduces the peaks of pulsating torque generated in any rotor position while using the machine wingdings as filter. Simulation tests have been carried out to validate the control strategy, taking into account the system efficiency.

383,"It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) enabled electric vehicle (EV) charger is of a reactive power compensation ability with a battery or capacitor connected. To exploit the aggregated reactive power V2G abilities of massively dispersed EV chargers, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) strategy applying to both balanced and unbalanced distribution networks (DNs) is proposed to integrate them into real-time DN voltage regulation. Firstly, based on the instantaneous power theory and voltage sensitivity matrices, a voltage regulation model considering the reactive response of EV chargers is established without violating the normal EV active charging demands. Then, a completely distributed framework is achieved by DMPC, in which prediction information and calculation results are shared in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) way to realize the asynchronous broadcast. The proposed model and techniques are validated by numerical results obtained from the IEEE European low voltage test feeder system. The case studies indicate that the proposed DMPC is robust to communication latency (CML) and works effectively in both balanced and unbalanced DNs without any control center, which is a significant advantage for the promotion of real-time reactive power V2G in DNs with irregular user integration and relatively poor communication infrastructure.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9526869/,LOCKED,9526869,2,0,Journals,10.1109/TSG.2021.3109453,588,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9526869/,9662085,1949-3061,1.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9526869,Jan. 2022,5165411,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2022,IEEE,384,576,A Distributed MPC to Exploit Reactive Power V2G for Real-Time Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks,13,"[{'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089207141', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Jindi Hu', 'id': 37089207141}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086481980', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Chengjin Ye', 'id': 37086481980}, {'affiliation': 'College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37277996200', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Yi Ding', 'id': 37277996200}, {'affiliation': 'Internet Office, State Grid Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089208943', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Jinjiang Tang', 'id': 37089208943}, {'affiliation': 'Marketing Service Center, State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company Ltd., Hangzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089206341', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Si Liu', 'id': 37089206341}]","['Distribution network (DN)', 'electric vehicle (EV) chargers', 'vehicle-to-grid (V2G)', 'reactive power compensation', 'distributed model predictive control (DMPC)']","['Voltage control', 'Reactive power', 'Vehicle-to-grid', 'Peer-to-peer computing', 'Real-time systems', 'Batteries', 'Distribution networks']"
384,"It has been suggested that the main battery voltage of electric vehicles is increased from 400 to 800 V to improve the charging speed and driving distance. However, the secondary components in the dc/dc converter of the on-board charger have high voltage stresses due to the increased battery voltage. Therefore, this article proposes a low voltage charging technique. The previously designed and optimized dc/dc converter for 400 V battery is used to charge 800 V battery. The battery stack is divided into two modules. Dc/dc converter charges one of two modules alternatively using the battery selection circuit (BSC). Since the BSC has low voltage stresses, the proposed converter can have low voltage stresses on all the dc/dc and BSC parts. Moreover, the dc/dc converter and BSC can be decoupled by turning <small>off</small> the dc/dc converter while changing the charged battery. Therefore, the loss of BSC can be minimized by operating it with low frequency because the switching frequency of BSC can be independent of that of the dc/dc converter. The design process can also be simpler owing to decoupling operation.

386,"Three-phase <i>CLLC</i> resonant converters provide higher power conversion capability as compared to half-bridge and full-bridge structures. In addition to the unique features of <i>CLLC</i> converters for bidirectional applications, the three-phase structure provides significantly reduced output current ripple (smaller output capacitor), parallel power processing (reduced components size and current peak stress), and better thermal distribution (smaller heatsinks). However, with practical, i.e., nonzero, resonant component tolerances, these benefits are normally less, and sometimes significantly less than expected in the ideal case.

390,"For a broad range of industrial, service, and household electric vehicles, dynamic charging is a viable option for energy replenishing that could reduce the size of the onboard energy storage, remove range limitations, and increase operating time. For these systems, timely detection of an approaching vehicle and the detection of strong coupling conditions between transmitter and receiver coils are of prime interest. A novel method is proposed in this article, which utilizes the existing embedded transmitter coil and power electronics modules to establish a precise detection system based on the power footprint of a traveling receiver. Next, a control algorithm is proposed to control charger activation and deactivation time accurately and deliver the required energy during the maximum coupling of the coils. The proposed sigmoid-curve-based control algorithm achieves a robust, speed-independent, smooth transition between two states while providing fast dynamics for aligned and misaligned conditions.

391,"China’s railways are developing rapidly, and the charger of the auxiliary power supply system is an indispensable part of the maglev train. The existing maglev train charger usually uses the traditional PID controller to control the output of the charger which has a simple structure. To meet the requirements of the maglev train charger output performance which is getting higher and higher, it is necessary to optimize the control strategies which can achieve adaptive control of the system.

393,"A three-phase buck-type rectifier features a step-down ac–dc conversion function, which is considered as a prominent solution for electric vehicle chargers and telecommunication systems integrated to the grid above 380 V line to line. However, traditional solutions for those applications employ cascaded architectures with an ac–dc boost-type stage and a dc–dc buck-type stage, which may suffer from high switching losses and large dc-link capacitor volume. To relieve this issue, a straightforward carrier-based two-phase-clamped discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) strategy with generalized zero-sequence voltage injection is proposed in this article for the commonly employed cascaded circuit. This method can stop the switching actions in the front-end stage during two-third of the grid period, which can yield to the best switching loss reduction. The operations of the front- and back-end converter stages become highly coupled to each other, which reduces the size requirement of the capacitor in the dc link. Therefore, the equivalent circuit behaves as a quasi-two-stage buck-type rectifier allowing an enhancement of the system power density by improving power conversion efficiency and by reducing the volume of passive components and heat sink. The proposed carrier-based two-phase-clamped DPWM strategy is described, analyzed, validated, and compared with different pulsewidth modulation methods on PLECS-based simulation and a 5-kW prototype.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9627562/,LOCKED,9627562,0,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2021.3130677,5211,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9627562/,9687117,1941-0107,5.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627562,May 2022,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2022,IEEE,394,5196,A Carrier-Based Two-Phase-Clamped DPWM Strategy With Zero-Sequence Voltage Injection for Three-Phase Quasi-Two-Stage Buck-Type Rectifiers,37,"[{'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086367754', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Junzhong Xu', 'id': 37086367754}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, DC Systems, Energy Conversion and Storage Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37392767900', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Thiago Batista Soeiro', 'id': 37392767900}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, DC Systems, Energy Conversion and Storage Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086941437', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Yang Wu', 'id': 37086941437}, {'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37400838100', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Fei Gao', 'id': 37400838100}, {'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37068181800', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Yong Wang', 'id': 37068181800}, {'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Control of Power Transmission and Conversion, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37711212800', 'author_order': 6, 'full_name': 'Houjun Tang', 'id': 37711212800}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, DC Systems, Energy Conversion and Storage Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37274746400', 'author_order': 7, 'full_name': 'Pavol Bauer', 'id': 37274746400}]","['Buck-type rectifier', 'carrier-based', 'discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (DPWM)', 'zero-sequence voltage injection']","['Voltage', 'Pulse width modulation', 'Phase modulation', 'Switches', 'Switching loss', 'Voltage control', 'Capacitors']"

As the mutual-capacitive fingerprint sensor is a smaller version of a projected-capacitive touch screen, this transparent fingerprint sensor can be mounted underneath screen cover glass. However, such glass significantly diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of fingerprint scanning AFE in proportion with increasing glass thickness. Moreover, external noise interferences from the display and charger are severe in displays with thin form factor. The proposed fingerprint scanning AFE can achieve a 17 atto-farad capacitance resolution using high-voltage (20 V) transmitters and multi-channel receivers comprising a pipelined readout amplifier, mixer, and second-order low-pass filter (128 kHz). A differential sensing structure and band-pass filtering are employed in the receiver front-end to enhance the noise immunity.

Furthermore, the converter can, respectively, establish three voltage gain modes of high, medium, and low to effectively widen voltage gain adjustment capabilities through the fixed-frequency plus phase-shift hybrid modulation independently adopted in each 3L-NPC bridge arm, while soft-switching is realized by phase control between resonant current and input voltage of RTM.

Finally, according to the simulation platform and experimental prototype, it can be shown that the practical voltage gain is close to the theoretical design gain and converter has good dynamic performances after realizing soft-switching in each mode.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9672731/,LOCKED,9672731,0,0,Journals,10.1109/TPEL.2022.3140902,6985,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9672731/,9714885,1941-0107,6.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9672731,June 2022,63,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2022,IEEE,399,6972,A Novel Bidirectional Five-Level Multimode <italic>CLLC</italic> Resonant Converter,37,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086570730', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Zhongyi Zhang', 'id': 37086570730}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086110879', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Tao Jin', 'id': 37086110879}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089299617', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Xiaosen Xiao', 'id': 37089299617}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089303893', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Weixin Wu', 'id': 37089303893}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical and Automation Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, China', 'authorUrl': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089303301', 'author_order': 5, 'full_name': 'Yishen Yuan', 'id': 37089303301}]","['Bidirectional on-board charger (OBC)', 'CLLC resonant tank module (RTM)', 'five-level', 'voltage gain modes', 'widen voltage gain adjustment capabilities']","['Bridge circuits', 'Voltage control', 'Topology', 'Modulation', 'Zero voltage switching', 'Resonant converters', 'Switches']"
399,"To accurately simulate electric vehicle DC fast chargers' (DCFCs') harmonic emission, a small time step, i.e., typically smaller than 10 μs, is required owing to switching dynamics. However, in practice, harmonics should be continuously assessed with a long duration, e.g., a day. A trade-off between accuracy and time efficiency thus exists. To address this issue, a multi-time scale modeling framework of fast-charging stations (FCSs) is proposed. In the presented framework, the DCFCs' input impedance and harmonic current emission in the ideal grid condition, that is, zero grid impedance and no background harmonic voltage, are obtained based on a converter switching model with a small timescale simulation. Since a DCFC's input impedance and harmonic current source are functions of the DCFC's load, the input impedance and harmonic emission at different loads are obtained. Thereafter, they are used in the fast-charging charging station modeling, where the DCFCs are simplified as Norton equivalent circuits. In the station level simulation, a large time step, i.e., one minute, is used because the DCFCs' operating power can be assumed as a constant over a minute. With this co-simulation, the FCSs' long-term power quality performance can be assessed time-efficiently, without losing much accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9675057/,OPEN_ACCESS,9675057,0,0,Journals,10.23919/CJEE.2021.000034,24,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9675057/,9675052,2096-1529,4.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9675057,Dec. 2021,7873788,Chinese Journal of Electrical Engineering,2021,CMP,400,15,Python supervised co-simulation for a day-long harmonic evaluation of EV charging,7,"[{'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, Delft University of Technology, Delft 2628 CD, Netherlands', 'author_order': 1, 'full_name': 'Lu Wang'}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, Delft University of Technology, Delft 2628 CD, Netherlands', 'author_order': 2, 'full_name': 'Zian Qin'}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, Delft University of Technology, Delft 2628 CD, Netherlands', 'author_order': 3, 'full_name': 'Lucia Beloqui Larumbe'}, {'affiliation': 'Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy, Delft University of Technology, Delft 2628 CD, Netherlands', 'author_order': 4, 'full_name': 'Pavol Bauer'}]","['Power quality', 'harmonic modeling', 'charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs)']","['Harmonic analysis', 'Load modeling', 'Impedance', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Power harmonic filters', 'Switches', 'Voltage measurement']"
400,"Electrification of the transportation sector has originated a worldwide demand towards green-based refueling infrastructure modernization. Global researches and efforts have been pondered to promote optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations. The EV power electronic systems can be classified into three main divisions: power charging station configuration (e.g., Level 1 (i.e., slow-speed charger), Level 2 (i.e., fast-speed charger), and Level 3 (i.e., ultra-fast speed charger)), the electric drive system, and the auxiliary EV loads. This paper emphasizes the recent development in Power Factor Correction (PFC) converters in the on-board charger system for short-distance EVs (e.g., e-bikes, e-trikes, e-rickshaw, and golf carts) and long-distance EVs (passenger e-cars, e-trucks, and e-buses). The EV battery voltage mainly ranges between 36 V and 900 V based on the EV application. The on-board battery charger consists of either a single-stage converter (a PFC converter that meets the demands of both the supply-side and the battery-side) or a two-stage converter (a PFC converter that meets the supply-side requirements and a DC-DC converter that meets the battery-side requirements). This paper focuses on the single-phase unidirectional non-isolated PFC converters for on-board battery chargers (i.e., Level 1 and Level 2 charging infrastructure). A comprehensive classification is provided for the PFC converters with two main categories: (1) the fundamental PFC topologies (i.e., Buck, Boost, Buck-Boost, SEPIC, Ćuk, and Zeta converters) and (2) the modified PFC topologies (i.e., improved power quality PFC converters derived from the fundamental topologies). This paper provides a review of up-to-date publications for PFC converters in short-/long-distance EV applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9693974/,CCBY - IEEE is not the copyright holder of this material.
