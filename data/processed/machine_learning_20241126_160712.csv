"Title: MPDM: A Multi-Paradigm Deployment Model for Large-Scale Edge-Cloud Intelligence. Abstract: The development of cloud and edge computing has enabled the easy access of artificial intelligence (AI) services for massive heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices. Particularly, computation-intensive AI services can be orchestrated and deployed in the cloud or edge according to varying performance and cost requirements. Nonetheless, the improved accessibility of deep learning (DL) model variants and the evolving of computational intelligence paradigms pose great challenges for orchestrating large-scale DL inference services in the cloud-edge continuum. Focusing on cloud or edge-based deployment, existing work on multi-variant service orchestration often has a limited solution space of deployment plans. To address this limitation, we first propose a novel multi-paradigm deployment model (MPDM) for service orchestration, which not only considers the model variants but also allows the co-existence of multiple paradigms for large-scale inference service deployment. The service deployment in the MPDM model is then formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem of seeking a better tradeoff among the system accuracy, service scale, and deployment cost. To solve the multiobjective optimization, we further propose a weighted metric-based constructive heuristic algorithm (WCH), which can efficiently obtain an approximately optimal Pareto frontier. Extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of WCH, and revealed the impacts of both multi-paradigm deployment and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI) paradigm on large-scale DL serving systems..

"Title: A Critical Survey of EEG-Based BCI Systems for Applications in Industrial Internet of Things. Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and its applications have seen a paradigm shift since the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, these methods are mostly data-centric and lack flexibility. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is envisioned as an efficient solution that may overcome the shortcomings of data-centric techniques by introducing human intuition in the process loop. In this work, we present an exhaustive study on the feasibility of adopting BCI techniques for industrial applications, particularly Electroencephalography (EEG). We present a comprehensive literature survey on the basics of EEG (including signal processing techniques) and its involved paradigms, together with its application scope. We identify the potential use cases of EEG-based BCI systems in industries in the current traction while accounting for their pros and cons. Additionally, we also highlight the existing challenges and propose possible off-the-shelf solutions for overcoming them. We present a two-pronged study (hardware and software specifications) on its deployment by performing lab-scale experiments with a single-channel EEG headset. We compare the metrics of our experiments to 64, 32, and 25 channel data from other studies (collected from the Internet). On average, we observe CPU usage of up to 35%, memory usage of 1.75 Gb, and data transfer rates of 25 Mbps. In contrast to the conventional setups, we demonstrate how a minimalistic setup using a single-channel EEG headset may facilitate complex applications like job inspection in manufacturing processes, with an overall accuracy of 70%..

"Title: Valve Stiction Detection Using Multitimescale Feature Consistent Constraint for Time-Series Data. Abstract: Using neural networks to build a reliable fault detection model is an attractive topic in industrial processes but remains challenging due to the lack of labeled data. We propose a feature learning approach for industrial time-series data based on self-supervised contrastive learning to tackle this challenge. The proposed approach consists of two components: data transformation and representation learning. The data transformation converts the raw time-series to temporal distance matrices capable of storing temporal and spatial information. The representation learning component uses a convolution-based encoder to encode the temporal distance matrices to embedding representations. The encoder is trained using a new constraint called multitimescale feature consistent constraint. Finally, a fault detection framework for the valve stiction detection task is developed based on the feature learning method. The proposed framework is evaluated not only on an industrial benchmark dataset but also on a hardware experimental system and real industrial environments..

"Title: A D2D-Aided Federated Learning Scheme With Incentive Mechanism in 6G Networks. Abstract: Pervasive new era applications are expected to involve massive amount of data to implement intelligent distributed frameworks based on machine learning, supported by sixth generation (6G) networks technology to offer fast and reliable communications. Federated Learning (FL) is rapidly emerging as promising privacy-preserving solution to train machine learning models in a distributed fashion. However, users are often not too inclined to take part in the learning process without receiving compensation. Hence, to overcome this drawback, the functional integration of a proper devices incentive mechanism with an efficient approach for the devices selection in a same FL framework becomes essential. In this regard, this paper proposes a FL framework involving a one-side matching theory-based incentive mechanism to select and encourage users to take part of the process with the aim at minimizing the FL process convergence time and maximizing the users profit. Furthermore, this paper faces with the possibility to overcome bad communication link conditions by resorting to device-to-device communications among users in order to lower the energy wasted and improve the convergence time of the FL process. In particular, an echo-state-network, running in local at each user site, has been considered to forecast channel conditions in a reliable manner. Performance evaluation has highlighted the improvements in convergence time and energy consumption of the proposed FL framework in comparison with conventional approaches, hence, highlighting its suitability for applications in the upcoming 6G networks..

"Title: Two-Person Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Human Interaction Recognition. Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been the predominant methods in skeleton-based human action recognition, including human-human interaction recognition. However, when dealing with interaction sequences, current GCN-based methods simply split the two-person skeleton into two discrete graphs and perform graph convolution separately as done for single-person action classification. Such operations ignore rich interactive information and hinder effective spatial inter-body relationship modeling. To overcome the above shortcoming, we introduce a novel unified two-person graph to represent inter-body and intra-body correlations between joints. Experimental results show accuracy improvements in recognizing both interactions and individual actions when utilizing the proposed two-person graph topology. In addition, several graph labeling strategies are designed to supervise the model to learn discriminant spatial-temporal interactive features. Finally, we propose a two-person graph convolutional network (2P-GCN). Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks of three interaction datasets: SBU, interaction subsets of NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120..

"Title: On the Convergence of Hybrid Server-Clients Collaborative Training. Abstract: Modern distributed machine learning (ML) paradigms, such as federated learning (FL), utilize data distributed at different clients to train a global model. In such paradigm, local datasets never leave the clients for better privacy protection, and the parameter server (PS) only performs simple aggregation. In practice, however, there is often some amount of data available at the PS, and its computation capability is strong enough to carry out more demanding tasks than simple model aggregation. The focus of this paper is to analyze the model convergence of a new hybrid learning architecture, which leverages the PS dataset and its computation power for collaborative model training with clients. Different from FL where stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is always computed in parallel across clients, the new architecture has both parallel SGD at clients and sequential SGD at PS. We analyze the convergence rate upper bounds of this aggregate-then-advance design for both strongly convex and non-convex loss functions. We show that when the local SGD has an  $\mathcal {O}(1/t)$  stepsize, the server SGD needs to scale its stepsize to no slower than  $\mathcal {O}(1/t^{2})$  in order to strictly outperform local SGD with strongly convex loss functions. The theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments, where advantages in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed over clients-only (local SGD and FED AVG) and server-only training are demonstrated..

"Title: Learning Approximate Execution Semantics From Traces for Binary Function Similarity. Abstract: Detecting semantically similar binary functions – a crucial capability with broad security usages including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, and forensics – requires understanding function behaviors and intentions. This task is challenging as semantically similar functions can be compiled to run on different architectures and with diverse compiler optimizations or obfuscations. Most existing approaches match functions based on syntactic features without understanding the functions’ execution semantics. We present Trex, a transfer-learning-based framework, to automate learning approximate execution semantics explicitly from functions’ traces collected via forced-execution (i.e., by violating the control flow semantics) and transfer the learned knowledge to match semantically similar functions. While it is known that forced-execution traces are too imprecise to be directly used to detect semantic similarity, our key insight is that these traces can instead be used to teach an ML model approximate execution semantics of diverse instructions and their compositions. We thus design a pretraining task, which trains the model to learn approximate execution semantics from the two modalities (i.e., forced-executed code and traces) of the function. We then finetune the pretrained model to match semantically similar functions. We evaluate Trex on 1,472,066 functions from 13 popular software projects, compiled to run on 4 architectures (x86, x64, ARM, and MIPS), and with 4 optimizations (O0-O3) and 5 obfuscations. Trex outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by 7.8%, 7.2%, and 14.3% in cross-architecture, optimization, and obfuscation function matching, respectively, while running 8× faster. Ablation studies suggest that the pretraining significantly boosts the function matching performance, underscoring the importance of learning execution semantics. Our case studies demonstrate the practical use-cases of Trex – on 180 real-world firmware images, Trex uncovers 14 vulnerabilities not disclosed by previous studies. We release the code and dataset of Trex at https://github.com/CUMLSec/trex..

"Title: A Data-driven Agent-based Planning Strategy of Fast-Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles. Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to play an important role in mitigating carbon emissions. To accommodate the increasing number of EVs, the co-planning of electrical distribution networks and the charging infrastructure, such as fast-charging stations (FCSs), becomes an emergent task. Both the charging demand of EVs and the stability of the electricity network should be satisfied. In this paper, we proposed a data-driven agent-based planning strategy for FCSs. Different from the conventional planning strategy, we utilized machine learning tools to consider EV behaviors at the microscopic level in a planning problem. First, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process of EVs is established, and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the charging and driving decisions of EVs under different transportation network typologies and FCSs planning schemes. Second, a data-driven agent-based traffic assignment model (DA-TAM) is proposed to aggregate the atomic behaviors of EVs, which can present the sensitivity of the traffic flow and EV charging demand to the FCS planning schemes. Third, the DA-TAM is adapted to the proposed planning model to ensure the quality of service and prevent unbalanced traffic flow. Through the proposed method, microscopic behaviors of EVs can be reflected, and the impact of the planning scheme on the traffic condition can be revealed. The proposed methodologies are verified in the case studies. The presented agent-based planning strategy can serve more EV charging demands, cause less waiting time in FCSs to enhance the quality of service, and encounter less severe traffic unbalance problems..

"Title: Model-Based and Graph-Based Priors for Group Testing. Abstract: The goal of the group testing problem is to identify a set of defective items within a larger set of items, using suitably-designed tests whose outcomes indicate whether any defective item is present. In this paper, we study how the number of tests can be significantly decreased by leveraging the structural dependencies between the items, i.e., by incorporating prior information. To do so, we pursue two different perspectives: (i) As a generalization of the uniform combinatorial prior, we consider the case that the defective set is uniform over a subset of all possible sets of a given size, and study how this impacts the information-theoretic limits on the number of tests for approximate recovery; (ii) As a generalization of the i.i.d. prior, we introduce a new class of priors based on the Ising model, where the associated graph represents interactions between items. We show that this naturally leads to an Integer Quadratic Program decoder, which can be converted to an Integer Linear Program and/or relaxed to a non-integer variant for improved computational complexity, while maintaining strong empirical recovery performance..

"Title: Reducing Spatial Labeling Redundancy for Active Semi-Supervised Crowd Counting. Abstract: Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual in crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for semi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited labeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all individuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the None-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals in each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd images may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to break the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to reduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First, instead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to annotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness from both vertical and horizontal directions of initially estimated density maps, and formulate them as cluster centers of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich unlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd image to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation instead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods. In this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by individual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled regions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin..
